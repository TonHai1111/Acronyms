SSA Coordination Centre,True,SSA,True,Space Situational Awareness,"Space Weather service definitions Accuracy of service An estimate of the closeness of agreement between service output and the associated observable conditions. In practice this is reflected by an uncertainty value based on known performance statistics. Operational A product, tool or service that has been validated and certified suitable for use in the intended operational context. Pre-operational A product tool or service that has been validated against the criteria for use in the intended operational context but is not yet being demonstrated to meet operational use. Product Derived data generated using one or more Space Weather tool or model. A Product is a digital file(s) delivered to members of a user community from an operational element of the system that has a defined format and is archived or is reproducible. The generation of a product or a family of products is part of a service of the SWE Service Network or to the SWE Service Network. Software tools made available to users or a technical report are not considered as products. Reliability The ability of an element of the SWE service network to perform its required functions under its given operational conditions. The reliability of an element of the system is considered ""undetermined"" until it has been evaluated. When the element fulfils all predetermined criteria, it can be considered ""reliable"". Service A service is a collection of derived data products, software tools, technical reports and associated user support addressing the high-level requirements of a specific group of users as defined by the Customer Requirements Document. The ESA Space Safety Programme (S2P) The goal of ESAâ€™s Space Safety Programme is to contribute to the protection of our planet, humanity and assets in space and on Earth from threats originating in Space and to contribute to Europeâ€™s ability to safeguard its affected infrastructure from such threats as a service to its society. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) ESA programme starting in 2009. The objective of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system is to support the European independent utilisation of and access to space for research or services, through providing timely and quality data, information, services and knowledge regarding the environment, the threats, and the sustainable exploitation of the outer space. Tool(Kit) A software application which provides the end user with the facility to retrieve and/or process and further modify a given set of products according to their needs as part of a SWE Service. User requirement The specification of what the user expects of the product, service or system to provide in order to fulfil their needs. Validation Validation is a process which demonstrates that the product is able to accomplish its intended use in the intended operational environment. The status of the product following validation is ""validated"". Verification is a pre-requisite for validation. Verification Verification is a process which demonstrates through the provision of objective evidence that the product is designed and produced according to its specifications and the agreed deviations, and is free of defects. Verification can be accomplished by one or more of the following methods: "
