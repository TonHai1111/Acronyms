allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6
hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one
half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These
instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the
equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors
(J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities,

The NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) spacecraft lifted off aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket from Space Launch Complex 2 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Oct. 28, 2011 at 5:48 a.m. EDT.

The NPP spacecraft will build on more than four decades Earth observation to help us better understand our climate.

The National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project (NPP) is a joint mission involving the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA) and the NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO).  

The NPP mission collects and distributes remotely-sensed land, ocean, and atmospheric data to the meteorological and global climate change communities as the responsibility for these measurements transitions from existing Earth-observing missions such as Aqua, Terra and Aura, to the NPOESS. It will provide atmospheric and sea surface temperatures, humidity sounding, land and ocean biological productivity, and cloud and aerosol properties.

For the IPO, NPP provides risk reduction with an opportunity to demonstrate and validate new instruments and processing algorithms, as well as to demonstrate and validate aspects of the NPOESS command, control, communications and ground processing capabilities prior to the launch of the first NPOESS spacecraft.

The CALIPSO satellite was developed to help scientists answer significant questions and provide new information about the effects of clouds and aerosols (airborne particles) on changes in the Earths climate. Understanding these components will provide the international science community with a more comprehensive data set that is essential for a better understanding of the Earths climatic processes. Accurate climate model predictions will provide international and national leaders accurate information to make more informed policy decisions about global climate change.

CALIPSO flies a 3-channel lidar with a suite of passive instruments in formation with Aqua to obtain coincident observations of radiative fluxes and atmospheric conditions. This enables new observationally based assessments of the radiative effects of aerosol and clouds that will greatly improve out ability to predict future climate change.

CloudSat also flies in formation with CALIPSO to provide a comprehensive characterization of the structure and composition of clouds and their effects on climate under all weather conditions. This comprehensive set of measurements is essential for accurate quantification of global aerosol and cloud radiative effects to understand their role in formation and variation of Earths climate. This is a cooperative mission with France.

This provides scientists from all over the world with an efficient and cost-effective way to map the Earths gravity fields with unprecedented accuracy. The results from this mission yield crucial information about the distribution and flow of mass within the Earth and its surroundings.

The gravity variations that GRACE studies include: changes due to surface and deep currents in the ocean; runoff and ground water storage on land masses; exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the oceans; and variations of mass within the Earth. Another goal of the mission is to create a better profile of the Earths atmosphere.

0,AERONOMY OF ICE IN THE MESOSPHERE,Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere,"NASAs AIM spacecraft began its two-year mission April 25, 2007 after a flawless ride to Earth orbit aboard an Orbital Sciences Pegasus XL rocket. Launch took place at 1:26 PDT. Launch operations at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California ran smoothly, with no technical or weather issues causing concern.

The AIM mission is the first dedicated to exploring mysterious ice clouds that dot the edge of space in Earths polar regions. These clouds have grown brighter and more prevalent in recent years and some scientists suggest that changes in these clouds may be the result of climate change.

0,AERONOMY OF ICE IN THE MESOSPHERE,Aeronomy of Ice In the Mesosphere,"AIM is the first satellite mission dedicated to the study of noctilucent or “night-shining” clouds (NLCs) also called Polar Mesospheric clouds (PMCs). It has provided the first global-scale view of the clouds over the entire 2007 Northern Hemisphere season with an unprecedented resolution of 5 km by 5 km and is nearing completion of observations in the Southern Hemisphere season. Despite a significant increase in PMC research in recent years, relatively little is known about the basic physics of these clouds at ”the edge of space” and why they are changing. They have increased in brightness over time, are being seen more often and appear to be occurring at lower latitudes than ever before. The overall goal of the baseline mission is to determine why PMCs form and vary. Since the launch of AIM on April 25, 2007, significant progress has been made in achieving this goal and that progress continues at a rapid rate. The AIM data is of very high quality and has changed our view of PMCs and their environment after only one northern hemisphere (NH) season of observations. The startling similarity between the PMC structure observed by CIPS and that seen in tropospheric clouds suggests that the mesosphere may share some of the same dynamical processes responsible for weather near Earth’s surface. If this similarity holds up in further analysis, it introduces an entirely different view of potential mechanisms responsible for PMC formation and variability. 

AIM has provided the most detailed picture of NH clouds ever collected:

- The clouds appear every day, are widespread and are highly variable on hourly to daily time scales.
- PMC brightness varies over horizontal scales of a few kilometers, and because of the AIM high horizontal resolution, we now know that over small regions the clouds are ten times brighter than measured by previous space-based instruments.
- A previously suspected, but never before seen, population of very small ice particles was measured that is believed to be responsible for strong radar echoes from the summertime mesosphere.
- Mesospheric ice occurs in one continuous layer extending from below the main peak at 83 km up to around 90 km.
- Mesospheric cloud structures, resolved for the first time by the CIPS imager, exhibit complex features present in normal tropospheric clouds.

0,AQUARIUS SAC-D,AQUARIUS SAC-D,"Mission Overview
 The joint U.S./Argentinian Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas (SAC)-D mission will map the salinity—the concentration of dissolved salt—at the ocean surface, information critical to improving our understanding of two major components of Earths climate system: the water cycle and ocean circulation. By measuring ocean salinity from space, Aquarius will provide new insights into how the massive natural exchange of freshwater between the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice influences ocean circulation, weather and climate.

Because ocean surface salinity varies from place to place and over time, scientists can use it to trace the oceans role in Earths water cycle. For example, more than 85 percent of global evaporation and more than 75 percent of global precipitation occur over the ocean. By measuring changes in ocean surface salinity caused by these processes, as well as by ice melting and river runoff, Aquarius/SAC-D will provide important new information about how Earths freshwater moves between the ocean and atmosphere and around the globe.

Knowing ocean surface salinity can also help scientists track ocean currents and better understand ocean circulation. Salinity, together with temperature, determines how dense and buoyant seawater is. This, in turn, drives how ocean waters are layered and mixed and the formation of water masses. Salinity also has a major effect on ocean circulation, including the flow of currents that move heat from the tropics to the poles.

Aquarius/SAC-D will provide essential ocean surface salinity data needed to link the water cycle and ocean circulation—two major components of the climate system. This information, in turn, will help scientists improve the accuracy of computer climate models.

Global ocean salinity has been an area of much scientific uncertainty. Past measurements of salinity have been limited mostly to summertime observations in shipping lanes. Recently, a European mission has begun making ocean surface salinity measurements. With the launch of Aquarius/SAC-D, scientists will collect more data in the missions first few months than had been amassed by ships and in-water sensors during the previous 125 years.

Scheduled for launch no earlier than June 2011, Aquarius/SAC-D is designed to measure ocean surface salinity for at least three years, repeating its global pattern every seven days. During its lifetime, the mission will provide monthly maps of global changes in ocean surface salinity with a resolution of 150 kilometers (93 miles), showing how salinity changes from month-to-month, season-to-season and year-to-year. The spacecraft will fly in a sun-synchronous orbit 657 kilometers (408 miles) above Earths surface.

NASAs Aquarius is the primary instrument on the SAC-D spacecraft. It consists of three passive microwave radiometers to detect the surface emission that is used to obtain salinity and an active scatterometer to measure the ocean waves that affect the precision of the salinity measurement. While salinity levels in the open ocean generally range from 32 to 37 practical salinity units, or psu (roughly equivalent to parts per thousand), the Aquarius sensor will be able to detect changes in salinity as small as 0.2 psu. This is equivalent to about a pinch (i.e., 1/8 of a teaspoon) of salt in one gallon of water.

Aquarius/SAC-D is a collaboration between NASA and Argentinas space agency, Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), with participation from Brazil, Canada, France and Italy. The Aquarius instrument was jointly built by NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. JPL will manage Aquarius through the missions commissioning phase and will archive mission data. Goddard will manage the missions operations phase and process Aquarius science data. NASAs Launch Services Program at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida is managing the launch. CONAE is providing the SAC-D spacecraft, an optical camera, a thermal camera in collaboration with Canada, a microwave radiometer, sensors developed by various Argentine institutions, and the mission operations center in Argentina.

GPM Constellation is envisioned to consist of a core spacecraft to measure precipitation structure and to provide a calibration standard for the constellation spacecraft, an international constellation of NASA and contributed spacecraft to provide frequent precipitation measurements on a global basis, calibration/validation sites distributed globally with a broad array of precipitation-measuring instrumentation, and a global precipitation data system to produce and distribute global rain maps and climate research products.

The GPM Core Observatory carries the first space-borne Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and a multi-channel GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). The DPR instrument, which provides three dimensional measurements of precipitation structure over 78 and 152 mile (125 and 245 km) swaths, consists of a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) operating at 35.5 GHz and a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) operating at 13.6 GHz. Relative to the TRMM precipitation radar, the DPR is more sensitive to light rain rates and snowfall. In addition, simultaneous measurements by the overlapping of Ka/Ku-bands of the DPR can provide new information on particle drop size distributions over moderate precipitation intensities. In addition, by providing new microphysical measurements from the DPR to complement cloud and aerosol observations, GPM is expected to provide further insights into how precipitation processes may be affected by human activities.

The GMI instrument is a conical-scanning multi-channel microwave radiometer covering a swath of 550 miles (885 km) with thirteen channels ranging in frequency from 10 GHz to 183 GHz. The GMI uses a set of frequencies that have been optimized over the past two decades to retrieve heavy, moderate and light precipitation using the polarization difference at each channel as an indicator of the optical thickness and water content.

Preliminary indications are that the fairing on the Taurus XL launch vehicle failed to separate. The fairing is a clamshell structure that encapsulates the satellite as it travels through the atmosphere.

The spacecraft did not reach orbit and likely landed in the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica, said John Brunschwyler, the program manager for the Taurus XL.

A Mishap Investigation Board is to determine the cause of the launch failure.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) is a new Earth orbiting mission sponsored by NASAs Earth System Science Pathfinder Project (ESSP) Program. The ESSP Program funds competitively selected, low to moderate cost Earth Science missions. These highly focused missions acquire exploratory measurements of the atmosphere, the oceans, the land surface and the solid Earth. These missions share a common goal of improving the capability of Earth scientists to predict changes in weather, climate and natural hazards.

After launch in 2009, the OCO mission will collect precise global measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earths atmosphere. Scientists will analyze OCO data to improve our understanding of the natural processes and human activities that regulate the abundance and distribution of this important greenhouse gas. This improved understanding will enable more reliable forecasts of future changes in the abundance and distribution of CO2 in the atmosphere and the effect that these changes may have on the Earths climate.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will lead the OCO effort. Orbital Sciences Corporation and Hamilton Sundstrand Sensor Systems will partner with JPL to realize this vital mission.

0,UPPER ATMOSPHERE RESEARCH SATELLITE,Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite,"Following the deployment of the Goddard Space Flight Centers (GSFC) Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) on Sept. 15, 1991, from the Space Shuttle Discovery, scientists have gained a better understanding of the energy input, chemistry and dynamics of the upper atmosphere and the coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere. UARS, the first satellite dedicated to studying stratospheric science, focuses on the processes that lead to ozone depletion, complementing and amplifying the measurements of total ozone made by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) onboard NASAs Nimbus-7 and the Russian Meteor-3 satellites. UARS also measures winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the energy input from the Sun.  

Ten UARS instruments have provided the most complete data on upper atmospheric energy inputs, winds, and chemical composition ever gathered. Together, these observations constitute a highly integrated investigation of the nature of the upper atmosphere, and help define the role of the upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability. In its first two weeks of operation, UARS data confirmed the polar ozone-depletion theories by providing three-dimensional maps of ozone and chlorine monoxide near the South Pole during development of the 1991 ozone hole. UARS, developed and managed by GSFC, in Greenbelt, Md., provides information that nations around the world can use to guide decisions on environmental policies, according to scientists.  

Moreover, UARS collected data on the chemistry, dynamics, and radiative inputs to the upper atmosphere far beyond its designed lifetime, obtaining over 13 years of observations for many atmospheric constituents, temperature, winds, and external forcings.  UARS was decommissioned in 2005. The United Kingdom and Canada both provided instruments for this mission. UARS is the first spacecraft launched as part of NASAs systematic, comprehensive study of the Earth system.

0,UPPER ATMOSPHERE RESEARCH SATELLITE,Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite,"NASA officially announced its intent to develop the Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite (UARS) in 1979. Nine instruments and a group of
theoretical investigators were chosen by an open proposal selection
process. An additional instrument, ACRIM, was given a flight of
opportunity on the UARS spacecraft. Due to funding delays and the
Challenger accident, UARS was not launched until 1991. UARS is
considered the first of the Mission to Planet Earth (now Earth Science
Enterprise) series of NASA spacecraft.

UARS was launched on September 15, 1991 by the Space Shuttle
Discovery. It is 35 feet long, 15 feet in diameter, weighs 13,000
pounds, and carries 10 instruments. UARS orbits at an altitude of 375
miles with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees. Designed to operate
for three years, eight of its ten instruments are still
functioning. UARS measures ozone and chemical compounds found in the
ozone layer which affect ozone chemistry and processes. UARS also
measures winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the
energy input from the Sun. Together, these help define the role of the
upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability.

The UARS Project Mission Objectives are to study the
a) energy input and loss in the upper atmosphere
b) global photochemistry of the upper atmosphere
c) dynamics of the upper atmosphere
d) coupling among these processes
e) coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere

Four UARS instruments were devoted to measurements of constituents
that spectroscopically determine the concentrations of many different
chemical species and derived the variation of atmospheric temperature
with altitude by observing infrared emissions from carbon dioxide
(CO2). The instruments are:
1) Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES)
2) Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS)
3) Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)
4) Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE)

Two instruments, utilizing high-resolution interferometry, will studied
upper-atmosphere winds by sensing the Doppler shift in light absorbed
by or emitted from atmospheric molecules. The wind instruments are:
1) High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI)
2) Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII)

An additional four investigations obtained estimates of the energy
incident on the atmosphere by measuring solar ultraviolet radiation
and the flux of charged particles from the Earths magnetosphere.
These are:

0,GLOBAL OSCILLATION NETWORK GROUP,Global Oscillation Network Group,"The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) is a community-based project to conduct a detailed study of solar internal structure and dynamics using helioseismology. In order to exploit this new technique, GONG has developed a six-station network of extremely sensitive, and stable velocity imagers located around the Earth to obtain nearly continuous observations of the SUNs five-minute oscillations, or pulsations.

The site comprising the GONG Network are:
Big Bear, California
Cerro Tololo, Chile
Learmonth, Australia
Mauna Loa, Hawaii
Udaipur, India
Observatorio del Teide, Canary Islands

The five-minute oscillation is a subtle effect. Individual modes may exhibit velocities of less than 0.2 meters/second, while the sum of all of the modes is only a few hundred meters/second. The ultimate intention is to have the measurements be limited by the Suns ``random surface motions. This means developing six stable instruments capable of making imaged velocity measurements with a precision of significantly less than one meter/second - one part in ten million! A low technological risk instrument based on a Michelson interferometer was selected, and it will be supported by a highly automated, portable installation, somewhat reminiscent of a spacecraft experiment.

Each station in the network will produce more than 200 megabytes of data every day. Over the three year observing run, the raw data will exceed one terabyte, and the various processed data sets will exceed this several-fold. To keep up with the data flow, a pipe-line capable of roughly 6 Megaflops has be established to do the bulk processing and provide subsets of the data for the scientific community. Because of the widespread scientific participation, distributed data, software and analysis tools will be provided. Thus, in addition to a central facility, participating scientists will have access to readily transportable data archives and software, as well as shared analysis programs at their home institutions.

The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project was proposed in 1984 by
the National Solar Observatory as a community activity.  Funding for the
project from the National Science Foundation started in 1986.  The project is
intended to provide 3 years of nearly uninterrupted helioseismograms to allow
detailed study of the stratification and dynamics of the solar interior.
The project is in the process of developing a network of observational sites
and an instrument based on the principle of Fourier tachometry to do the
observing.  In addition the GONG datacenter will store the network data and
do the standard data reduction.  Science teams have been organized and are
actively engaged in providing technical support for various aspects of the
project and are preparing for the analysis and interpretation of the data
products.

data, ice cap shrinkage data, and ozone layer depletion data. It is theorized
that as much as 25 percent of the Earths total global warming may be solar in
origin due to small increases in the Suns total energy output since the last
century. By measuring incoming solar radiation and adding measurements of ocean

The Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, will maintain the nations real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities
which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of NOAAs space weather alerts and forecasts. Without timely and accurate warnings, space weather events like the geomagnetic storms caused by changes in solar wind have the potential to disrupt nearly every major public infrastructure system, including power grids, telecommunications, aviation and GPS.

DSCOVR will succeed NASAs Advanced Composition Explores (ACE) role in supporting solar wind alerts and warnings from the L1 orbit, the neutral gravity point between the Earth and sun approximately one million miles from Earth. L1 is a good position from which to monitor the sun, because the constant stream of particles from the sun (the solar wind) reaches L1 about an hour before reaching Earth.

0,POLAR,POLAR,"The Polar spacecraft was launched on February 24, 1996, to obtain data from
both high- and low-altitude perspectives of this active region of geospace.
High above the poles the particles of the solar wind and the energy of the wind
can find their way into the magnetosphere. At lesser altitudes energy is
transferred from electric fields and electromagnetic waves to electrons that
then plunge into the atmosphere to create the aurora. At mid-altitudes nearer
the equator the satellite passes through the Earths trapped radiation, the Van
Allen belts. Out of the polar ionosphere flows plasma to populate the
magnetosphere. Through this region particles and energy flow from the
geomagnetic tail to the atmosphere. Thus the instruments on the Polar
satellites see a lot of action in the various plasma parameters that they
measure.

Three of the twelve scientific instruments aboard the Polar satellite are used
to image the aurora in various wavelengths when the satellite is near apogee,
high over the northern polar region. The other nine instruments make
measurements in-situ, at the location of the satellite, around the entire
orbit. They measure the fluxes of charged particles, electrons and protons,  as
well as heavier ions, from thermal energies into MeV energies. They measure
magnetic and electric fields, plus electromagnetic waves. They must make these
measurements in great detail in order for scientists to be able to learn new
things about the environment in the region over the poles of the Earth.

The Polar satellite is in a highly elliptical orbit, with apogee at 9 earth
radii and perigee at 1.8 earth radii geocentric. The inclination is 86 deg. and
the period about 18 hours. Initially apogee was over the northern polar region,
but apogee has been moving towards the equator at about 16 deg. per year.  The
nominal mission duration was two years, but a three year extended  mission has
been approved.  

Details on the POLAR mission and instrumentation are provided in Space Science
Reviews (Vol. 71, Nos. 1-4, 1995) and reprinted in The Global Geospace Mission,
edited by C. T. Russell (Kluwer, 1995).

SORCE is a NASA-sponsored satellite mission that will provide state-of-the-art
measurements of incoming x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and total
solar radiation. SORCE represents the merging of the EOS Solar Stellar
Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) and the Total Solar Irradiance
Mission (TSIM). The measurements provided by SORCE specifically address
long-term climate change, natural variability and enhanced climate prediction,
and atmospheric ozone and UV-B radiation. These measurements are critical to
studies of the Sun, its effect on our Earth system, and its influence on
humankind.

Solar radiation is the dominant, direct energy input into the terrestrial
ecosystem, and it affects all physical, chemical, and biological processes. The
Sun provides a natural influence on the Earths atmosphere and climate. In
order to understand mankinds roles in climate change, the Suns impact must
first be understood.

SORCE measures the Suns output with the use of state-of-the-art radiometers,
spectrometers, photodiodes, detectors, and bolometers engineered into
instruments mounted on a satellite observatory. The SORCE satellite orbits
around the Earth accumulating solar data. Spectral measurements identify the
irradiance of the Sun by characterizing the Suns energy and emissions in the
form of color that can then be translated into quantities and elements of
matter. Data obtained by the SORCE experiment will be used to model the Suns
output and to explain and predict the effect of the Suns radiation on the
Earths atmosphere and climate.

SORCE was successfully launched on January 25, 2003 on a Pegasus XL
launch vehicle to provide NASAs Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) with
precise measurements of solar radiation. It was launched into a 645
km, 40 degree orbit and will be operated by the Laboratory for
Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado
(CU) in Boulder, Colorado, USA. It will continue the precise
measurements of total solar irradiance (TSI) that began with the ERB
instrument in 1979 and has continued to the present with the ACRIM
series of measurements. SORCE will also provide the measurements of
the solar spectral irradiance from 1nm to 2000nm, accounting for 95%
of the spectral contribution to TSI. SORCE will carry four instruments
including the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM), Solar Stellar Irradiance

The series, originally planned to acquire data throughout the Suns 11-year active cycle, investigated how Earths atmosphere and climate are affected by the Sun, and by the products of industrial complexes and agricultural activities.  ATLAS 1, the first spacecraft in this series conducted 14 investigations in atmospheric science, solar physics, space plasma physics, and astrophysics.

The 14 ATLAS 1 experiments included:
(1) Atmospheric Lyman-Alpha Emissions (ALAE)
(2) Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)
(3) Grille Spectrometer (GRILLE)
(4) Imaging Spectrometric Observatory (ISO)
(5) Millimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS)
(6) Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrometer (SSBUV-4) -
technically, this instrument was seperate from the ATLAS payload and
was a co-manifested payload
(7) Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM)
(8) Solar Spectrum Measurement (SOLSPEC)
(9) Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM)
(10) Measurement of the Solar Constant (SOLCON)
(11) Atmospheric Emissions Photometric Imaging (AEPI)
(12) Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators (SEPAC)
(13) Energetic Neutral Atom Precipitation (ENAP). ENAP was not a
seperate instrument but used the ISO instrument measurements
(14) Far Ultraviolet Space Telescope (FAUST)

ATLAS 2 was flown on the STS-56 in April 1993 and consisted of seven of the ATLAS 1 instruments: ATMOS, MAS, SSBUV-5, ACRIM, SOLSPEC, SUSIM, AND SOLCON.

ATLAS 3 was flown on the STS-66 in November 1993 and consisted of the same instruments as ATLAS 2.

These investigations studied the chemical makeup of the atmosphere between approximately 15 and 600 kilometers (8.3 to 330 miles) above the Earths surface, measured the total energy contained in sunlight and energy variations, investigated how Earths electric and magnetic fields and atmosphere influence each other, and examined sources of ultraviolet light in the Universe.  The instruments were mounted on two Spacelab pallets in the Shuttle payload bay.  The Shuttles changing orientation to Earth placed the experiments in advantageous orbiting locations, to observe the atmosphere, the Sun, and astronomical targets.  Specifically, the orbiter orientation was either inertially fixed so that selected instruments were pointed at the sun, or nadir pointed for observations of the Earths atmosphere. Crew members were in consultation with the investigators while controlling and monitoring the experiments. The atmospheric and solar instruments provided correlative measurements with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).

Lidar is an active remote sensing technology (the laser version of radar) which uses pulses of laser light to measure 3D structure. The light is reflected by the ground, vegetation and any clouds and is then collected by GEDI’s telescope. These photons are then directed towards detectors, converting the brightness of the light to an electronic voltage which is then recorded as a function of time in 1 ns (15 cm) intervals. Time is converted to range (a distance) by multiplying by the speed of light. The recorded voltage as a function of range is the full-waveform.

0,CLOUD-AEROSOL TRANSPORT SYSTEM,Cloud-Aerosol Transport System,"The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), launched on 10 January 2015, is a lidar remote sensing instrument that provides range-resolved profile measurements of atmospheric aerosols and clouds. Data from CATS is used to derive properties of cloud/aerosol layers including: layer height, layer thickness, backscatter, optical depth, extinction, and depolarization-based discrimination of particle type. The instrument is located on the Japanese Experiment Module – Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) on the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS orbit is a 51-degree inclination orbit at an altitude of about 405 km. This orbit provides more comprehensive coverage of the tropics and mid-latitudes than sun-synchronous orbiting sensors, with nearly a three-day repeat cycle. CATS is intended to operate on-orbit for at least six months, and up to three years. The CATS payload is designed to provide a combination of long-term operational science, in-space technology demonstration, and technology risk reduction for future Earth Science missions. 

Science Goals:
The measurements of atmospheric clouds and aerosols provided by the CATS payload will be used for three main science objectives:

1. Provide real-time observations of aerosol vertical distribution as inputs to global models. The vertical profile information obtained by CATS, particularly at multiple wavelengths and with depolarization information obtained in Modes 1 and 3, provides height location of cloud and aerosol layers, as well as information on particle size and shape.

2. Extend the space-based lidar record for continuity in the lidar climate observations. The CATS instrument will provide measurements of cloud and aerosol profiles similar to CALIPSO, filling in the data gap, so this information can continually be used to improve climate models and our understanding of the Earth system and climate feedback processes.

3. Advance technology in support of future space-based lidar mission development by demonstrating the ability to retrieve vertical profiles using the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) technique and 355 nm wavelength.

Modes of Operation:
To meet these three science goals, CATS operates in three different modes using four instantaneous fields of view (IFOV):

Mode 1 Multi-beam backscatter detection at 1064 and 532 nm, with depolarization measurement at both wavelengths.
Mode 2 Demonstration of HSRL aerosol measurements.
Mode 3 Demonstration of 355-nm profiling.

as an effort to produce an autonomous system for measuring water vapor
levels from airborne and spaceborne platforms using LIDAR technology.

The LASE Instrument:

The transmitter consists of a Ti:sapphire laser pumped by a double
pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The frequency of the Ti:sapphire laser is
controlled by injection seeding using a diode laser that is frequency
locked to a water vapor line in the 815-nm region. The on and off
wavelengths are separated by less than 70 pm. The laser pulses are
sequentially transmitted with about 400 microseconds separation. This
permits the use of the same avalanche photodiodes (APD) for detecting
the lidar returns. The use of low and high light level APDs provides
linear response to atmospheric and cloud/ground returns,
respectively. Lidar returns at 5 Hz are digitized and recorded, and
when possible, the data are telemetered to the LASE ground station for
real-time processing and experiment control. Operation with strong and
weak absorption regions of a preselected water vapor line can be made
during the mission to optimize the measurement of water vapor in
different altitude regions.

The LASE system has proven to be a reliable, accurate, and sensitive
water vapor profiler with the ability to measure water vapor mixing
ratios over a large dynamic range (0.01 g/kg to 20 g/kg). Aerosol
backscatter ratios can be measured from ground to 20 km with a
vertical resolution of 30 m and a horizontal resolution of 40 m.

The MHS is a new instrument for the NOAA series of satellites. It is a five-channel microwave instrument intended primarily to measure profiles of atmospheric humidity. It is also sensitive to liquid water in clouds and measures cloud liquid water content. Additionally, it provides qualitative estimates of the precipitation rate. 

Because of the high variability of atmospheric water, the MHS has a higher resolution than the AMSU-A, with an approximate 16-km (1 mi) diameter circular field of view at nadir. Ninety such fields of view are measure in each cross-track scan. The instrument has approximately the same swath width as AMSU-A but scans across-track in one-third the time in order to keep the two instruments synchronized. By this means, arrays of 3 x 3 MHS samples will overlay each AMSU-A sample, facilitating synergistic use of these instruments. 

MHS has four humidity channels in the 157 GHz to 190 GHz range. As with AMSU-A, it also has a surface-viewing window channel at 89 GHz, partly to ensure cross-registration of the two sounding instruments.

0,MEASUREMENTS OF POLLUTION IN THE TROPOSPHERE,Measurements of Pollution In The Troposphere,"The objective of the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) spectrometer is to measure emitted and 
reflected infrared radiance in the atmospheric column to permit retrieval of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) 
profiles and total column methane. Observations of CO and methane will be used to study how these gases interact 
with the surface, ocean, and biomass systems. The MOPITT instrument is bases on the principle of correlation 
spectroscopy utilizing both pressure-modulated and length-modulated gas cells, with detectors at 2.3, 2.4, and 
4.7 micrometer. Atmospheric profiles of CO are measured with the 4.7 micrometer detector. CO and methane are measured 
by the 2.4 and 2.3 micrometer channels, respectively, sense solar radiation reflected from the surface. The MOPITT
is a scanning instrument with a field-of-view of 1.8 degrees (22-km footprint at nadir). The scan line consists of 28
pixels, each at 1.8 degree increments with a maximum scan angle of 25.2 degrees off-axis (swath width of 620-km). 
MOPITT data products are expected to include gridded retrievals of methane with a horizontal resolution of 120 km 
at 1 % accuracy and gridded CO soundings with 10 % accuracy in three vertical layers between 0 and 15 km.  The

0,MEASUREMENTS OF POLLUTION IN THE TROPOSPHERE,Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere,"The MOPITT launched on the AM-1 platform of NASAs Earth
Observing System (EOS). The AM-1 satellite was placed in a
705km, sun-synchronous orbit with a 10:30am equator crossing
time. MOPITT will measure carbon monoxide and methane in the
troposphere over the entire globe for a period of five years.

Despite the fact that we all live in the troposphere, monitoring
of the tropospheric composition from space has lagged
considerably behind our monitoring of the upper regions of the
earths atmosphere mainly because of the technical difficulty of
such measurements. The presence of the earths surface provides
considerable interference to most measurement methodologies and
the presence of clouds further impedes the mission. Overcoming
these problems requires a very precise instrument with a very
high performance.

We want to monitor carbon monoxide and methane because they will
help us understand how the troposphere reacts to various
stimuli. These can range from natural phenomena such as the
growth of forests, through agricultural sources such as rice
paddies, to catastrophic events such as biomass burning. Most of
these sources can, and indeed are, being modified by human
activity on the planet.

Carbon monoxide is particularly interesting because of its
potential for showing us how chemicals are transported in the
troposphere as well as giving us information about chemical
reactions in the troposphere.

Measurements have already shown us the production of carbon
monoxide in biomass burning and its transport by atmospheric
circulation systems. This needs to be understood on a global
scale and incorporated into models of tropospheric transport.

Methane is a greenhouse gas and the major issue here is its
source strength. There are a large number of potential sources,
such as northern wetlands, ruminant animals, and natural gas
leakage. However the actual strength of the individual sources
is very poorly known. Since methanes greenhouse effect is far
stronger than that of the better known carbon dioxide, changes
in methane, although small in themselves, can potentially have a
significant effect on the overall climate system.

Measurements of these gases are made by intercepting the
infra-red radiation coming from the planet and then isolating
the required signals. MOPITT is a nadir sounding instrument
since this gives the maximal chance of avoiding cloud features,
but this implies that it can see the surface of the planet and
the desired signals must be seen against the background of the
surface radiation. The field-of-view of MOPITT is 22 x 22km and
it views four fields simultaneously by the use of a 4 x 1 array
of detector elements. The field of view is also continuously
scanned through a swath about 600km wide as the instrument moves
along the orbit increasing both the spatial coverage of the
instrument and the chance of finding gaps in the cloud coverage.

The MOPITT instrument makes use of the principle of correlation
spectroscopy whereby a cell of the gas to be measured is used as
an optical filter in the infra-red to measure the signal from
the same gas in the atmosphere. The amount of gas in the
instrument cell is modulated by varying either the pressure or
the length. In addition to the correlation technique MOPITT
makes use of mechanically cooled detectors and filters (at 100K)
to enhance the overall performance. The use of this cooling
technique, which relies on Stirling Cycle coolers supplied by
British Aerospace, is relatively new in satellite
instrumentation having been used on only two civilian satellite
instruments before. The use of mechanical cooling rather than
stored cryogen or radiative cooling permits a relatively large
amount of cooling - sufficient for both the detectors and the
filter systems - whilst still permitting a five year instrument
life.

The MOPITT science team is international, having members from
Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. The instrument
itself is being constructed by a consortium of Canadian
companies: COMDEV Atlantic of Moncton, BOMEM from Quebec City,
Hughes-Leitz from Midland and SED from Saskatoon. The instrument
is funded by the Space Science Division of the Canadian Space
Agency. The instrument will be tested in the University of
Toronto.

MOPITT completed its Preliminary Design Review in December 1993
and the Critical Design Review is scheduled for April
1995. Instrument delivery will be late in 1996 and the launch of
the AM-1 platform will be in mid- 1998. Discussions are under
way regarding a second copy of the instrument to be launched in
the 2003 time frame to permit the dataset of carbon monoxide and
methane to be extended to ten years to look for long term
effects.

0,SCANNING HIGH-RESOLUTION INTERFEROMETER SOUNDER,Scanning High-Resolution Interferometer Sounder,"The Scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (S-HIS) is a cross-track scanning interferometer sounder which measures emitted thermal radiation at high spectral resolution between 3.3 and 18 microns. The measured spectrally resolved radiance is used for a variety of applications, including retrieval of temperature and water vapor profiles of the Earths atmosphere, determination of surface emissivity and temperature, and validation of radiative transfer models and satellite measurements. The S-HIS produces sounding data with 2 kilometer spatial resolution (at nadir) across a 40 kilometer ground swath from an altitude of 20 kilometers (0.100 mrad FOV). The S-HIS instrument flies on a number of airborne platforms including the NASA ER-2, DC-8, Proteus, WB-57, and Global Hawk. On the Proteus and WB-57 aircraft, a zenith view is available, providing a means for calibration verification and studies of upper level water vapor.

The S-HIS is an advanced version of the HIS NASA ER-2 instrument. The S-HIS was initially designed to fly on an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) with limited payload capacity. This drove it to be small, lightweight, and modular, with low power consumption. It was developed between 1996 and 1998 at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) with the combined support of the US DOE, NASA, and the NPOESS Integrated Program Office. Its design and calibration techniques have matured from experience with the HIS and with the ground based Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) instruments developed for the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program. The nadir-only spatial sampling of the original HIS has been replaced by programmable cross-track coverage with similar sized footprints. The S-HIS is also smaller, more robust, and easier to operate. Since 1998, the S-HIS has flown in several field campaigns and has proven to be extremely dependable and effective.

The S-HIS instrument is maintained and operated by the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, WI. The principal scientific investigator for the S-HIS is Dr. Joe K Taylor",SHIS,GCMD instruments

0,WATER VAPOR SENSING SYSTEM,Water Vapor Sensing System,"The Water Vapor Sensing System (WVSS) was used for obtaining
weather observations which was a revolution in that it used a
convenient platform for a variety of environmental parameters.

History:

The FAA interest in the WVSS program is to support the Aviation
Weather Research Program. Researchers will use the data to
improve algorithms for the detection, analysis and prediction of
mesoscale weather phenomena and activity which affects the
aviation industry: ceiling and visibility, precipitation type
and amount, thunderstorms, microbursts, and icing. Two other
areas where water vapor has a secondary role are in convective
turbulence (where water vapor gradients affect atmospheric
stability) and in flight-level winds where the synoptic scale
wind patterns are often significantly disrupted by mesoscale
outflow (where water vapor plays a role in mesoscale development
and decay).

Program:

Results of the first phase of evaluation of the WVSS-I, which
uses a thin-film capacitor to measure relative humidity, are
available from this web site under the document entitled Water
Vapor Profiles from Commercial Aircraft.  THese results include
evaluation of measurements from the six UPS B-757 aircraft that
had the Allied Signal avionics and the WVSS-I software.  Results
from six months of data (July 1, 1999 to December 31, 1999) from
these WVSS-I equipped aircraft reveal that the commercial
aircraft profiles are competitive with radiosondes on
ascent/descent and superior to radiosondes in the upper
troposphere.

Comparisons of opportunity with radiosondes (when equipped
aircraft made ascent/descents near a radiosonde site) also
revealed the capability of depicting the moist absolutely
unstable layers (MAULs) describe by Bryan and Fritsch (2000).
See the document above for the detailed reference.  A number of
examples of MAULs including those seen in radiosondes are shown
in this document.  Statistics on the occurrence of MAULs (in the
commercial aircraft data and in radiosondes) are also provided.

Data from the second phase of the WVSS-I evaluation (after the
new Teledyne avionics equipment had replaced the Allied Signal
avionics is available to users as describe below.  One of the
limitations of the WVSS-I technology ( the Vaisala thin-film
capacitor technology which was an improved version over that
same sensor used in Vaisala radiosondes) is the aging of the
sensor over time.  This aging eventually results in a dry-bias
over time -- requiring that the sensor be replaced and then
recalibrated.

Note that such aging takes place while the unit sits on a shelf
(although presumably at a slower pace than when it is in
operation on the aircraft). THere is considerable variability in
this aging process -- this being one of the major reasons for
abandoning this sensor for the WVSS-II sensor described below.

As the WVSS-I Program is experimental (not operational) with a
limited budget, these sensors were not immediately replaced when
they should have been -- instead, part of the evaluation process
was to see how long the sensors would last.  Thus, Table 1 below
shows those time periods when the 30 UPS aircraft were
installed, working, and did not exhibit the obvious dry-bias.
This table will be maintained on a monthly basis through
calendar year 2002.  The green-filled boxes are the months with
good data.

0,GEOSTATIONARY EARTH RADIATION BUDGET,Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget,"The MSG system has been outlined to support additional or research missions. ESA selected the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument for flight on the MSG-1 satellite. The GERB instrument is developed by a European consortium led by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), United Kingdom, under a cooperation between the UK, Italy and Belgium. The EUMETSAT Council decided in November 1998 to fund the flight of two additional GERB instruments on MSG-2 and MSG-3.
 The first images from the GERB instrument flying on Meteosat-8  (MSG-1) were taken on 12 December 2002. 

The principle objective of the GERB mission is to measure the Earth radiation budget, in support of climate research and monitoring. A GERB International Science Team (GIST) had been established and tasked inter alia to define the science requirements, products and processing algorithms, and to implement science and validation activities. The consortium that developed and is responsible for operating the GERB system includes the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), UK; Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine (ICSTM), UK; Hadley Centre, UK; Leicester University, UK; RMI, Belgium; Advanced Mechanical and Optical Systems Ltd (AMOS Ltd), Belgium; and Officine Galileo, Italy. 

The Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMI) was a key player in the development of the GERB concept, and Belgium provides half of the GERB ground segment infrastructure and services.

The GERB instrument, as part of the satellite, is operated by EUMETSAT in coordination with the GERB Operations Team based at ICSTM.GERB data are received at the EUMETSAT ground segment and passed to the GERB ground segment for data processing. The data and products are then distributed by RAL to centres throughout Europe which use the information to evaluate and improve climate monitoring and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models.

The GERB instrument is a scanning radiometer with two broadband channels, one covering the solar spectrum (0.32 to 4.0 µm), the other covering a wider portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (0.32 to 30 µm).  Together these channels are used to derive the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth in the spectral range 4.0 to 30 µm. Data are calibrated on board in order to support the retrieval of radiative fluxes of reflected solar radiation and emitted thermal radiation at the top of the atmosphere with an accuracy of 1%. The radiation budget represents the balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing thermal (longwave) and reflected (shortwave) energy from the Earth.

The GERB broadband channels span the twelve much narrower channels measured by the MSGs other instrument  the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). Thus GERB fills in the gaps in the thermal radiation spectrum missed by the SEVIRI channels. However, the GERB measures the thermal radiation at a coarser spatial resolution. Back on the ground, RMI scientists use the finer spatial resolution of the SEVIRI data to improve the spatial resolution of the GERB images.

0,MULTI-ANGLE IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER,Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer,"No instrument like MISR has flown in space before. Viewing the sunlit
Earth simultaneously at nine widely spaced angles, MISR provides
ongoing global coverage with high spatial detail. Its imagery is
carefully calibrated to provide accurate measures of the brightness,
contrast, and color of reflected sunlight.

MISR provides new types of information for scientists studying Earths
climate, such as the partitioning of energy and carbon between the
land surface and the atmosphere, and the regional and global impacts
of different types of atmospheric particles and clouds on climate. The
change in reflection at different view angles affords the means to
distinguish different types of atmospheric particles (aerosols), cloud
forms, and land surface covers. Combined with stereoscopic techniques,
this enables construction of 3-D models and estimation of the total
amount of sunlight reflected by Earths diverse environments.

0,SEA-VIEWING WIDE FIELD-OF-VIEW SENSOR,Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor,"[SeaWiFS collected data from September 1997 until the end of its mission in December 2010]

The SeaWiFS instrument was launched by Orbital Sciences Corporation on the OrbView-2 (a.k.a. SeaStar) satellite in August 
1997, and collected data from September 1997 until the end of mission in December 2010. SeaWiFS had 8 spectral bands from 
412 to 865 nm. It collected global data at 4 km resolution, and local data (limited onboard storage and direct broadcast) 
at 1 km. The mission and sensor were optimized for ocean color measurements, with a local noon (descending) equator crossing 
time orbit, fore-and-aft tilt capability, full dynamic range, and low polarization sensitivity.

The SeaWiFS instrument has scanning mechanisms to
drive an off-axis folded telescope and a rotating halfangle
mirror. Incoming scene radiation is collected
by the folded telescope and reflected onto the rotating
half-angle mirror. The collected radiation is then relayed
through dichroic beam splitters to separate the radiation
into four wavelength intervals each wavelength interval
encompassing two of the eight SeaWiFS spectral bands.
Four corresponding aft-optics direct the radiation in the
four separate wavelength intervals through two separate
spectral band-pass filters that further separate the radiation
into eight SeaWiFS spectral bands. The aft-optics
assemblies also image each of the resultant defined bands
of radiation onto four detectors that are aligned in the scan
direction. Monitoring of sensor calibration over periods of
a few orbits, to several months or years, is accomplished
using solar calibration for the former and lunar calibration
for the latter. Solar calibration uses a solar-radiation
diffuser and an input port located in a fixed position
outside of the 58.3 degree SeaWiFS scene-scan interval. Lunar
calibration is accomplished by a spacecraft maneuver to
view the moon when the spacecraft is in the nighttime
portion of its orbit.

0,SEA-VIEWING WIDE FIELD-OF-VIEW SENSOR,Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor,"purpose of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS)
Project is to provide quantitative data on global ocean bio-optical
properties to the Earth science community. Subtle changes in ocean
color signify various types and quantities of marine phytoplankton
(microscopic marine plants), the knowledge of which has both
scientific and practical applications. The SeaWiFS Project operates a
research data system that processes, calibrates, validates, archives
and distributes data received from SeaWiFS. The SeaWiFS Mission is a
part of NASAs Earth Science Enterprise.

The SeaStar spacecraft, developed by OSC, carries the SeaWiFS
instrument and was launched to low Earth orbit on board an extended
Pegasus launch vehicle on August 1, 1997.

The SeaWiFS data is procured as a data buy from a private
contractor, Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), which subcontracted
with the Hughes Santa Barbara Research Center (SBRC) as the builder of
the SeaWiFS ocean color sensor. OSC built, launched, and operates the
SeaStar satellite carrying the sensor.

The GSFC EOS DAAC has the responsibility for the permanent archiving
and distribution of SeaWiFS data to all approved SeaWiFS data
users. The SDPS provides processed data to the GSFC DAAC. Authorized
users may also request LAC data archived at NASA-licensed HRPT
stations. A consolidated, on-line, electronic catalog of all holdings
of SeaWiFS data at Goddard or NASA-licensed HRPT stations is available
to all authorized SeaWiFS research users. Requests for data not held
by the GSFC DAAC will be directed to the LAC station that holds the
data. Fees, if any, for copies of SeaWiFS data can be no higher than
the nominal cost of reproduction of the requested data. The EOS DAAC
will support the distribution of data in its holdings through
electronic means and on selected magnetic or optical media. Standing
orders for routine distribution of all or selected products, as they
become available, are subject to approval by NASA.

0,EARTH RADIATION BUDGET EXPERIMENT,Earth Radiation Budget Experiment,"The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), flown on the Earth
Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and the NOAA Polar Orbiting
Environmental Satellites (NOAA-9, NOAA-10), was designed to measure the
energy exchange between the earth-atmosphere system and space.  The
measurements of global, zonal, and regional radiation budgets on
monthly time scales helped in climate prediction and in the
development of statistical relationships between regional weather and
radiation budget anomalies. The ERBE consisted of two seperate
instrument packages: the nonscanner (ERBE-NS) instrument and the
scanner (ERBS-S) instrument. The ERBE-NS instrument had five sensors,
each using cavity radiometer detectors. Four of them were primarily
earth-viewing. Two wide-field-of-view (WFOV) sensors viewed the entire
disk of the earth from limb to limb, approximately 135 deg. Two medium
FOV (MFOV) sensors viewed a 10-deg region. The fifth sensor was a
solar monitor that measured the total radiation from the sun. Of the
four earth-viewing sensors, one WFOV and one MFOV sensor made total
radiation measurements; the other two measured reflected solar
radiation in the shortwave spectral band between 0.2 and 5 micrometers
by using Suprasil-W filters. The earth-emitted longwave radiation
component was determined by subtracting the shortwave measurement from
the total measurement. The ERBE-S instrument was a scanning radiometer
that contained three narrow FOV channels. One channel measured
reflected solar radiation in the shortwave spectral interval between
0.2 and 5 micrometers. Another channel measured earth-emitted
radiation in the longwave spectral region from 5 to 50 micrometers.
The third channel measured total radiation with a wavelength between
0.2 and 50 micrometers. All three channels were located within a
continuously rotating scan drum, which scanned the FOV across track
sequentially from horizon to horizon. Each channel made 74 radiometric
measurements during each scan, and the FOV of each channel was 3 by
4.5 deg, which covered about 40 km at the earths surface.  The ERBE-S
also viewed the sun for calibration.

0,EARTH RADIATION BUDGET EXPERIMENT,Earth Radiation Budget Experiment,"The radiation budget represents the balance between incoming energy
from the Sun and outgoing thermal (longwave) and reflected (shortwave)
energy from the Earth. In the 1970s, NASA recognized the importance
of improving our understanding of the radiation budget and its effects
on the Earths climate. Langley Research Center was charged with
developing a new generation of instrumentation to make accurate
regional and global measurements of the components of the radiation
budget. The Goddard Space Flight Center built the Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS) on which the first Earth Radiation Budget
Experiment (ERBE) instruments were launched by the Space Shuttle
Challenger in 1984. ERBE instruments were also launched on two
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather monitoring
satellites, NOAA 9 and NOAA 10 in 1984 and 1986.

An international team of scientists was selected from proposals to an
Announcement of Opportunity in 1978 to participate in the design and
development of ERBE. Dr Bruce Barkstrom, of the Radiation Sciences
Branch of Langleys Atmospheric Sciences Competency, was selected as
the ERBE Principal Investigator. He led the team through 30 meetings
to guide the development of the instrumentation and the ground
processing software for analyzing the data.

The ERBE Data Management Team was formed to design and develop the
ground data processing system based on algorithms from the Science
Team. Jim Kibler, Head of the Data Management Office in Langleys
Atmospheric Sciences Competency, led the team through three iterative
releases of the system to be ready for processing at the first launch.

0,STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL AND GAS EXPERIMENT II,Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II,"The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) on the Earth
Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) was a seven-channel sunphotometer
which measured stratospheric aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and
nitrogen dioxide during spacecraft sunrise and sunset. The SAGE II
mission objectives were to (1) develop a long-term global climatology
of stratospheric aerosol extinction, (2) monitor transient events
(e.g. volcanic eruptions), (3) develop a high-altitude cloud climatology,
and (4) provide stratospheric ozone, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide
concentration profiles at 1 km vertical resolution. The SAGE II was a
two-axis gimbaled system capable of rotating in azimuth. The sun was
acquired when two azimuth sun sensors were activated and rotated in
azimuth until SAGE II was pointed at the radiometric centroid of the
sun. A scan mirror moved at fast rate of 3 deg/sec to acquire the sun.
The mirror scanned across the sun at a slow rate of 15 min/sec. When the
limb of the sun was reached, the servo mechanism reversed and scanned the
sun again. The sunlight was reflected into a Cassegranian telescope and
focused on an aperature that defined a 0.5-minute elevation angle by 2.5
minute azimuth angle instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV). The aperature was
the entrance slit to the spectrometer, which used a holographic grating and
filters to isolate the seven wavelength bands (0.385 to 1.02 micrometer).
Channels 1,2,3,4, and 7 used neutral density filters and channels 2,5, and 6
used bandpass filters. All seven channels were sampled within 1 ms at 64 Hz
and digitized to a 12-bit word. The SAGE II instrument measured the solar
irradiance during each spacecraft sunrise and sunset so that two profiles
from specific locations above the Earth were obtained during each spacecraft
revolution. SAGE II made about 15 sunrise and sunset measurements each
day, seperated by 24.5 degrees in longitude and slightly in latitude.
The maximum latitudes covered were 80 N to 80 S.

0,STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL AND GAS EXPERIMENT II,Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II,"Scientific Objectives:
Since October 1984, the SAGE II instrument has been flying aboard the
Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) collecting data that are being
processed and archived at NASA LaRC to produce four Level 2 data
products: aerosol extinction profiles at 1020, 525, 453, and 385
nanometers, and ozone, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide mixing ratio
profiles.  These products are nearly global in coverage, with data
spanning from 80 degrees North to 80 degrees South latitudes.
The accuracy of these data was verified by extensive validation
efforts and the data sets are now archived and available for general
scientific use. These data may be of use to investigators who are
interested in spatial and temporal variations of ozone, aerosols,
water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide caused by seasonal and short-term
meteorological variations, atmospheric chemistry and microphysics, and
transient phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions.  These data may also
be of some benefit for those who perform upper tropospheric studies of
aerosols or who perform climatology studies of cirrus clouds. SAM II,
SAGE I, and SAGE II have provided data sets that are now available for
use and provide a span of aerosol data from late 1978 up through the
present time.
Project Description:
The SAGE II instrument is a seven-channel Sun photometer using a
Cassegrainian-configured telescope, holographic grating, and seven
silicon photodiodes, some with interference filters, to define the
seven spectral channel bandpasses. Solar radiation is reflected off a
pitch mirror into the telescope with an image of the Sun formed at the
focal plane. The instruments instantaneous field-of-view, defined by
an aperture in the focal plane, is a 1/2 X 2-1/2 arc-minute slit that
produces a vertical resolution at the tangent point on the earths
horizon of about 0.5 kilometers.  Radiation passing through the
aperture is transferred to the spectrometer section of the instrument
containing the holographic grating and seven separate detector
systems. The holographic grating disperses the incoming radiation into
the various spectral regions centered at the 1020, 940, 600, 525, 453,
448, and 385 nanometer wavelengths. Slits on the Rowland circle of the
grating define the spectral bandpass of the seven spectral
channels. The spectrometer system is inside the azimuth gimbal to
allow the instrument to be pointed at the Sun without image
rotation. The azimuth gimbal can be rotated over 370 degrees so that
measurements can be made at any azimuth angle.
The operation of the instrument during each sunrise and sunset
measurement is totally automatic. Prior to each sunrise or sunset
encounter, the instrument is rotated in azimuth to its predicted solar
acquisition position. When the Suns intensity reaches a level of one
percent of maximum in the Sun sensor, the instrument adjusts its
azimuth position to lock onto the radiometric center of the Sun to
within +/-45 arc-seconds and then begins acquisition of the Sun by
rotating its pitch mirror in a predetermined direction depending on
whether it is a sunrise or a sunset. When the Sun is acquired, the
pitch mirror rotates back and forth across the Sun at a rate of about
15 arc-minutes per second. The radiometric channel data are sampled at
a rate of 64 samples per second per channel, digitized to 12-bit
resolution, and recorded for later transmission back to Earth.
The SAGE II experiment is ongoing.  The Langley DAAC continues to
archive these data.
Data Used and Produced:
The SAGE II science and engineering data, along with spacecraft time,
position, and housekeeping data, are stored aboard the spacecraft and
downlinked to NASA GSFC through a ground station. GSFC then forwards
these data to LaRC for processing and scientific analysis. GSFC also
sends spacecraft and solar ephemeris data to LaRC. These data are the
input to the inversion process which is explained in the next
section. At the completion of the data processing, four Level 2 SAGE
II products are produced: aerosol extinction profiles, ozone
concentration profiles, water vapor profiles, and nitrogen dioxide
profiles.
The SAGE2_AERO_PRF data set contains over ten years of aerosol
extinction profiles data.  Each granule consists of one month of data.

0,STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL AND GAS EXPERIMENT I,Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment I,"Scientific Objectives:
The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment I instrument, a Sun
photometer, aboard the Applications Explorer Mission-2 (AEM-2)
satellite began collecting data in October 1979.  The scientific
objective was to develop a global stratospheric aerosol, ozone, and
nitrogen dioxide database that could be used for the investigation of
the spatial and temporal variations of these species caused by
seasonal and short-term meteorological variations, atmospheric
chemistry, microphysics, and transient phenomena such as volcanic
eruptions.  The database could also be used for the study of trends,
atmospheric dynamics and transport, and potential climatic effects.
The SAGE I sensor was designed to measure the attenuation of solar
radiation resulting from atmospheric aerosol, ozone, and nitrogen
dioxide at four spectral regions through the Earths atmosphere during
each spacecraft sunrise and sunset.
Project Description:
The AEM-2 satellite was placed in an orbit of approximately 600
kilometers at an inclination of 56 degrees to extend the latitudinal
coverage for the solar occultation measurements from 79 degrees South
to 79 degrees North.
The SAGE I instrument consists of four spectral channels centered at
wavelengths of 1000, 600, 450, and 385 nanometers for measuring global
data concerning aerosol vertical extinction profiles, ozone vertical
concentrations profiles, and nitrogen dioxide vertical concentrations
profiles during spacecraft sunrise and sunset.  The solar wavelengths
of 1000 and 450 nanometers are used to generate altitude profiles of
ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentration.  The SAGE I aerosol data
were validated by comparison with correlative lidar and dustsonde in
situ measurements, the ozone data were validated by comparison with
balloon ECC ozonesonde and rocket measurements, and the nitrogen
dioxide measurements were compared with climatology.
The operation of the instrument, during each sunrise and sunset
measurement, was totally automatic.  Prior to each sunrise or sunset,
the instrument was rotated in azimuth to its predicted solar
acquisition position.  When the Sun entered the instruments field of
view, the instrument adjusted its azimuth position to lock onto the
radiometric center of the Sun to within +/- 45 arcsec and then
acquired the sun by rotating its scan mirror to the proper elevation
angle.  As the Sun traversed between the horizon and the tangent
height of 150 kilometers, radiometric channel data were sampled at a
rate of 64 samples per second per channel, digitized to 12-bit
resolution, and recorded for later transmission back to Earth.
Additional SAGE I instrument information can be found in McCormick et
al (1979).  The SAGE I instrument collected data for almost three
years until the AEM-2 satellite power subsystem failed.
Data Used and Produced:
The SAGE I science and engineering data, along with spacecraft time,
position, and housekeeping data, were stored aboard the spacecraft and
then down linked to NASA GSFC through a ground station.  GSFC then
forwarded these data to LaRC for processing and scientific analysis.
GSFC also sent spacecraft and solar ephemeris data to LaRC on separate
weekly tapes.
LaRC combines three data sources to produce the SAGE I MERDAT: (1) the
SAGE I instrument data, (2) the spacecraft and solar ephemeris data,
and (3) NOAA NMC temperature and density interpolations from the
standard NMC spatial gridded analyses at the 18 standard pressure
levels and at the tropopause for each tangent event location.
The MERDAT files are used as the data input to the inversion process.
At the completion of the data processing, three Level 2 SAGE I
products are produced: aerosol extinction profiles, ozone
concentration profiles, and nitrogen dioxide concentration profiles.
The SAGE1_AERO_PRF_NAT data set contains three years of aerosol
extinction profiles data.  Each granule consists of three months of
data (seasonal data) which is in the SAGE Is native binary format.
The data coverage begins February 1979 and extends through November
1981.  Data are stored in event format.  Each measurement event
consists of 48 parameters (does not include spares).
The SAGE1_AERO_PRF data set contains three years of aerosol extinction
profiles data.  Each granule consists of one month of data.  These
data are in Hiearchical Data Format (HDF).  The data coverage begins
February 1979 and extends through November 1981.  Data are stored in
parameter format.  Each measurement event consists of 38 parameters.
The Ozone Concentration Profiles data set is not currently available
at the Langley DAAC.  It will be archived in Hierarchical Data Format
(HDF).
The Nitrogen Dioxide Concentration Profiles data set is not currently
available at the Langley DAAC.  It will be archived in Hierarchical
Data Format (HDF).

The primary goal of the TES is the global mapping of tropospheric ozone and its photochemical precursors. The TES is a high spectral resolution infrared imaging Fourier transform spectrometer with spectral coverage from 2.3 to 16.7 micrometers with four single-line arrays optimized for different spectral regions. TES has the
capability to make both limb and down-looking observations. In the limb mode, tropospheric profiles of chemical species are made with a height resolution of 2.3 km from 0 to 30 km. In the down-looking mode, TES provides tropospheric profiles with a spatial resolution of 50 x 5 km (global) and 5 x 0.5 km (local), and a swath of 50 x 180 km (global) and 5 x 18 km (local). Both modes sensing thermal emission from the atmosphere and surface will be used to generate 3-dimensional profiles on a global scale for retrievals of O3, CO, CH4, H2O, and NOy from the surface to the lower stratosphere.

The satellite flies at an altitude of 705 km (438 miles) in an orbit that takes it near Earths North and South Poles. With each orbit, the spacecraft advances 22° westward. After 233 orbits (16 days), it is back at its starting point and the pattern repeats. Thus, every 16 days, Aura re-examines the same portions of the atmosphere, and its instruments are able to measure changes that may have occurred in each sampled area. The satellite and its instruments are scheduled to perform their atmospheric studies for five years.

0,TOTAL OZONE MAPPING SPECTROMETER,Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer,"The TOMS instrument is a second-generation backscatter ultraviolet ozone sounder. TOMS can measure total column ozone--the total amount of ozone in a column of air from the Earths surface to the top of the atmosphere--under all daytime observing and geophysical conditions. TOMS observations cover the near ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, where sunlight is absorbed only partially by ozone.

TOMS/EP measures total ozone by observing both incoming solar energy and backscattered ultraviolet (UV) radiation at six wavelengths. Backscattered radiation is solar radiation that has penetrated to the Earths lower atmosphere and is then scattered by air molecules and clouds back through the stratosphere to the satellite sensors. Along that path, a fraction of the UV is absorbed by ozone. By comparing the amount of backscattered radiation to observations of incoming solar energy at identical wavelengths, scientists can calculate the Earths albedo, the ratio of light reflected by Earth compared to that it receives. Changes in albedo at the selected wavelengths can be used to derive the amount of ozone above the surface.

The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data represent the primary long-term, continuous record of satellite-based observations available for use in monitoring global and regional trends in total ozone over the past 25 years. TOMS also provides measurements of tropospheric aerosols, volcanic SO2, ultraviolet irradiance, erythemal UV exposure, and effective reflectivity from the Earths surface and clouds. The data are produced by the Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center.

Four TOMS instruments have been successfully flown in orbit – aboard the Nimbus-7 (Nov. 1978 - May 1993), Meteor-3 (Aug. 1991 - Dec. 1994), Earth Probe (July 1996 - current), and ADEOS (Sep. 1996 - June 1997) satellites. Version 8 TOMS data products are available from the Goddard Earth Sciences Distributed Information and Services Center (GES DISC). These include level 3 gridded data (1.0° x 1.25°) as well as level 2 instrument resolution data (between 50x50 km and 26x26 km pixel at nadir). At this time, the data are from the Nimbus-7 and Earth Probe TOMS instruments.

The ACRIM instrument was first flown on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM/ACRIM I) satellite and was flown on all three Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS) missions and the Spacelab 1 misson from the Space Shuttle.  In addition, ACRIM was flown as a flight-of-opportunity instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS/ACRIM II) and is scheduled to fly as a flight-of-opportunity mission during NASAs Earth Observation System (EOS) program (ACRIMSAT/ACRIM III) The principal role of the ACRIM is to support extended solar irradiance experiments on free-flying satellites and establishment of the radiation scale at the solar total flux level through direct intercomparison with other experiments. The total solar irradiance (TSI) from far ultraviolet through far infrared is measured by three Type V active-cavity radiometer sensors. These detectors are electrically self-calibrated, cavity pyrheliometers each capable of defining the absolute radiation scale with an uncertainty of +/- 0.1% SI units. The single sample irradiance precision is +/-0.012 %. The three sensors are independently shuttered and their measurement cycles are different so that the three sensors can be used in various combinations to provide periodic cross references on the systems performance.

At the heart of the BATSE detectors are NaI crystals which
produce a flash of visible light when struck by gamma rays. The
flashes are recorded by light-sensitive detectors whose output
signal is digitized and analyzed to determine the arrival time

Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are continually improving in their ability to simulate the major features of today´s climate. Many of these models are being used to predict future climate change and although there is broad agreement among the models, there are also many differences in the details of their predictions. In order to determine whether models can simulate climatic conditions much different from today, the models can be used to simulate paleoclimates, and paleodata can be used to evaluate the results. Moreover, AGCMs have proved their usefulness to investigate mechanisms of past climate changes (e.g., Joussaume, 1999)). The Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) was initiated in order to coordinate and encourage the systematic study of AGCMs and to assess their ability to simulate large changes of climate such as those that occurred in the distant past. It also is serving to encourage the preparation of global reconstructions of paleoclimates that can be used to evaluate climate models.

The PMIP effort developed out of a NATO Advanced Research Workshop, convened in 1991, which led to a cooperative and coordinated effort to compare model simulations with paleoclimate data. The workshop participants agreed to focus initially on two specific periods in the past : the last glacial maximum, 21 000 years before present (BP), and the mid-Holocene climate, 6 000 years BP, which correspond to extreme conditions that are relatively well documented. Simulating the last glacial maximum provides an opportunity for assessing the models´ ability to simulate extreme cold conditions as well as for studying the feedbacks associated with both a decrease of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and ice sheet elevation of 2 to 3 km above North America and northern Europe. The simulation of the mid-Holocene conditions is on the other hand a sensitivity experiment in which the seasonal contrast of incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere is changed; 6000 years BP, the seasonal contrast was larger in the northern summer, leading to an increase of summer monsoons over Africa and South Asia.

A new field of ocean biogeochemistry emerged with an emphasis on quality measurements of carbon system parameters and interdisciplinary field studies of the biological, chemical and physical process which control the ocean carbon cycle. As we studied ocean biogeochemistry, we learned that our simple views of carbon uptake and transport were severely limited, and a new wave of ocean science was born.

Pennsylvania and Virginia; the District of Columbia; the Chesapeake
Bay Commission, a tri-state legislative body; the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, representing the federal government; and
participating advisory groups.

As the largest estuary in the United States and one of the most
productive in the world, the Chesapeake Bay was this nations first
estuary targeted for restoration and protection. In the late 1970s,
scientific and estuarine research on the Bay pinpointed three areas
requiring immediate attention: nutrient over-enrichment, dwindling
underwater Bay grasses and toxic pollution. Once the initialresearch
was completed, the Bay Program evolved as the means to restore this
exceptionally valuable resource.

Since its inception in 1983, the Bay Programs highest priority has
been the restoration of the Bays living resources- its finfish,
shellfish, Bay grasses, and other aquatic life and
wildlife. Improvements include fisheries and habitat restoration,
recovery of Bay grasses, nutrient and toxic reductions, and
significant advances in estuarine science.

Considered a national and international model for estuarine research
and restoration programs, the Bay Program is a partnership led by the
Chesapeake Executive Council. The members of the Executive Council are
the governors of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania; the mayor of the
District of Columbia; the administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission. The
Executive Council meets annually to establish the policy direction for
the Bay Program.

In the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement , the Executive Council set a
goal to reduce the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous entering the Bay
by 40% by 2000. Achieving a 40% nutrient reduction will ultimately
improve the oxygen levels in Baywaters and encourage aquatic life to
flourish. In 1992, the Bay Program partners agreed to continue the 40%
reduction goal beyond 2000 as well as to attack nutrients at their
source - upstream in the Bays tributaries. As a result, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia began developing
tributary strategies to achieve nutrient reduction targets.

On June 28, 2000, the Chesapeake Bay Program partners signed the new
Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, which will guide the next decade of
restoration and protection efforts throughout the Bay watershed. The

0,ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION AND OCEAN PLANKTON DYNAMICS,Atmospheric deposition and ocean plankton dynamics,"ADEPT is a scientific project (CTM2011-23458) funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation). ADEPT addresses the study of the effect of atmospheric aerosol deposition on the dynamics of a marine LNLC (low nutrient low chlorophyll) system, namely the Mediterranean. To achieve its goal, ADEPT uses a multiscale and complementary approach. Relationships between atmospheric deposition and ocean nutrient and plankton dynamics are studied at a coastal scale and at the Mediterranean basin scale. Laboratory experiments focus to understand some of the underlying mechanisms.",ADEPT,GCMD projects

Proposal URL:  http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=36

The overall goal of this initiative is to advance our knowledge of climate warming in the Arctic, by studying past climate change. We will focus mainly on the ocean circulation and climate of the NW Eurasian continental margin. The present climate in the Arctic shows signs of rapid change with decreasing sea ice cover and increasing temperature of the Atlantic Water. The implications of this warming are highly uncertain, as modelling experiments projecting temperatures for the next 100 years show a largescatter at high northern latitudes.

The project will include the following modules (M): M1 Rapid changes in the Atlantic Water inflow into the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, M2 Ice sheet/glacier response to warming, M3 Improving ocean temperature and sea-ice proxies; M4 Climate modelling.

M1: Periods in the past during which the climate was instable and reached warmer conditions than today: a) Marine isotope stages (MIS) 12/11; b) MIS 6/5; c) Younger Dryas/Holocene climate optimum, and d) last millennium. Sea Surface Temperature ( SST) will be quantified using a multidisciplinary approach, combining faunal/floral based transfer functions and geochemical tracers. For the Holocene and the last millennium climate will be investigated in marine sediments, lake sediments and ice cores from Svalbard and marine sediments from the SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland margin. Further, archaeological sites in Norway and Svalbard will be investigated to explore the relationship between climate and human settlement and activities. 

M2: Implications of climate warming for growth and decay of ice sheets and tide water glaciers, and its effect on ice stream dynamics in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard and SE Greenland margin.

M3: Reconstructions of SST below 5 OC based both on transfer functions and geochemical tracers are subject to large uncertainties. This is partly due to incomplete modern training sets at high latitudes. We aim to improve modern analogue data on planktonic and benthic foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, foraminiferal Ca/Mg-ratios and oxygen and carbon isotopes. From the same proxies we will also develop transfer functions for sea ice.

M4: An important motivation for attempting to simulate the climatic conditions of the past is that such experiments provide opportunities for evaluating how models respond to large changes in forcing.
Combined with high resolution acoustic data, cores will be sampled from high resolution sediment fans off northern and western Spitsbergen, the Spitsbergen fjords (in particular Kongsfjorden) and the Barents/Kara/Laptev Sea margin. Multi-core/box core surface samples >70ON in the NE Atlantic will be sampled. The SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland component will rely on existing seafloor samples. The project will include exchange programs and training courses for PhD students and young researchers.
