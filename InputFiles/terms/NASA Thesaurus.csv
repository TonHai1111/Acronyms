Mercator projection,"An equatorial, cylindrical, conformal map projection derived by mathematical analysis (not geometrically) in which the equator is represented by a straight line true to scale. The meridians are represented by parallel straight lines perpendicular to the equator and equally spaced according to their distance apart at the equator. The parallels are represented by straight lines perpendicular to the meridians and parallel with (and the same length as) the equator. The parallels are spaced so as to achieve conformality, their spacing increasing rapidly with their distance from the equator so that at all places the degrees of latitude and longitude have the same ratio to each other as to the sphere itself. This results in greater distortion of distances, areas, and shapes in the polar regions (above 80 deg. latitude). The scale is increasingly poleward as the secant of the latitude. Because any line of constant direction (azimuth) on the sphere is truly represented on the projection by a straight line, the Mercator projection is of great value in navigation. It is used for hydrographic charts, and also to show geographic variations of some physical property (such as magnetic declination) or to plot trajectories of Earth satellites in oblique orbits. It is named after Gerhardus Mercator (1512-1594), a Flemish mathematician and geographer, whose world map of 1569 used this projection."
