This glossary is designed to support the needs of senior Physics
students in Years 11 and 12 and covers the terminology used in the NSW course
and more. (*Updated)
A spectral class
Hot white stars (7,500 -10,000 K effective temperature). They show strong
H lines and ionised metal lines in their spectra. Examples include Sirius
A (A1 V), the brightest star in the night sky and Deneb (A2 Ia), a supergiant.
absolute magnitude (M)
The magnitude a star would appear to have if at a distance of 10 parsecs
from Earth. Absolute magnitude is a measure of a star’s intrinsic luminosity
and allows us to directly compare stars.
absorption spectra
Also called dark line spectra, these arise when photons of specific frequency
are absorbed by cooler gas, leaving a darker line on a background continuum
region. Most stellar spectra, including that from our Sun, are absorption
spectra.
active optics
Corrects distortions in the shape of large, thin primary mirrors due to
gravitational and structural flexing to provide a smoother surface. Typically
operates at a few hertz and uses actuators to align the mirror.
adaptive optics
Corrects for the distorting effects of the atmosphere on incoming light.
Some systems use a beam splitter, a reference or artificial star and powerful
computer processing to deform small tertiary mirror at a frequency of several
hundred hertz to compensate for the distortions. Current systems work better
at IR wavebands than in optical light.
Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO)
This joint British-Australian organisation operates the largest optical
telescope in Australia, the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) which is
located at Siding Spring in the Warrumbungles near Coonabarabran, NSW.
antenna
A radio telescope: a collecting ‘dish’ and associated equipment,
used for radio astronomy.
apparent magnitude
A measure of a star’s (or other celestial object’s) brightness
as measured from Earth. Originally developed as a six-point scale by Hipparchus,
now extended and open ended. Sirius, the brightest star in the night star
has an apparent magnitude of – 1.47 whilst the faintest detectable by
the naked eye is magnitude 6.
astrometric binary
A binary system in which the fainter member of the system is detected due
to its gravitational effect on the proper motion of its brighter companion.
The first one detected was Sirius B, now known to be the white dwarf companion
to Sirius A.
astrometry
The branch of astronomy concerned with the accurate measurement of the position
and proper motion of celestial objects.
astronomy
The scientific study of the Universe and what it contains (planets, stars,
galaxies, etc), and how these things formed and evolved over time. Not to
be confused with astrology, which is a set of beliefs about the influence
of heavenly bodies on human affairs. Astrology is not generally accepted to
be a science.
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
Comprises six 22m radio dishes on a 6km baseline. Located at Narrabri in
northern NSW it operates as a radio interferometer.
Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF)
Australia’s largest astronomical organisation, part of CSIRO, the
ATNF operates the Parkes radio telescope, the Australia Telescope Compact
Array at Narrabri and a single 22m dish at Mopra (near Siding Spring). Its
headquarters at Marsfield in Sydney has extensive workshop facilities where
new receivers and amplifiers for radio telescopes are designed and constructed.
It is also involved in developing the next generation of radio telescopes
such as SKA, the Square Kilometre Array.
B
The apparent magnitude of an object as measured through a B or ‘blue’
filter. Also called a photographic magnitude as it approximates the blue spectral
response of photographic film.
B spectral class
Very hot blue-white stars (10,000 - 28,000 K effective temperature). Characterised
by neutral He lines.
Balmer lines
Big Bang theory
The theory that the Universe ‘started’ with an event that created
time and space, about 13 billion years ago.
binary system
Two stars that revolve around a common centre of mass. Most star systems
are binary. Binary systems are important because they allow astronomers to
determine the masses of stars.
black hole
A highly condensed region of matter, with a gravitational attraction so
strong that anything that comes too close to it – even light –
cannot escape. Black holes can’t be seen, but can be detected through
the gravitational effects they exert on other objects. Some black holes are
the end product for massive stars as they evolve. Many galaxies have supermassive
black holes at their centre.
brightness
A measure of the amount of electromagnetic radiation from a celestial object.
it is expressed as a magnitude, which can be either apparent, whcih depends
on an object's intrinsic luminosity and its distance from the detector, or
absolute.
Cepheid variable
An important class of periodic pulsating variable star that obeys a period-luminosity
relationship discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. Type I or classical Cepheids
are giant luminous yellow stars with periods of 5 -10 days. Type II Cepheids
or W Virginis stars are about teo magnitudes dimmer than Type Is for the same
period and have periods of about 12 - 30 days. The longer the period of a
Cepheid, the more intrinsically luminous it is. This allows them to be used
as "standard candles" and are thus important distance indicators
for the extragalactic distance scale.
Chandrasekhar limit
The theoretical upper limit at which a stellar remnant can form a white
dwarf. Beyond this value (~1.4 solar masses) the electron degeneracy pressure
is unable to withstand gravitational collapse and the electrons are forced
into the nucleus where they combine with protons to form a dense sea of neutrons.
The remnant star is then a neutron star.
continuum
The continuous spectrum that any object would produce if no absorption or
emission lines were present. Any body above absolute zero emits a spectrum,
the shape of which is dependant on its temperature. thepeak of a continuous
spectrum can be used to determine the effective temperature of a blackbody-like
object such as a star.
CNO cycle
Abbreviation for "Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle (or carbon-cycle)". This
is a form of stellar nucleosynthesis in which hydrogen is fused into helium
in main sequence stars. This cycle uses carbon-12 nuclei as a nuclear catalyst.
It requires core temperatures of at least 14million K to initiate and dominates
at 20 million K or greater as is found in more massive main sequence stars,
those of O, B and A spectral class.
colour index CI = B – V
It provides a numerical value for the ‘colour’ hence effective
(surface) temperature of a star that can be measured directly by measuring
the apparent magnitude of the star through B and V filters.
dark nebula
A cool cloud of dust and gas. Due to its low temperature it does not emit
light in visible region of spectrum so appears dark, often blocking out light
from stars that are behind it. Best example is the Coal sack nebula in Crux.
distance modulus
Defined as m – M. A negative distance modulus means that
the object is closer than 10 parsecs to us whilst a positive value means that
it is further away than 10 parsecs.
Doppler shift
Refers to the apparent shift in spectral lines If a galaxy is moving towards
our Galaxy, or away from it, the light we see coming from that galaxy appears
different from what it would be if the galaxies were ‘standing still’.
If the two galaxies are approaching each other, the light becomes higher in
frequency (shifted towards the ‘blue’ end of the spectrum). If
the galaxies are moving further apart, the light becomes lower in frequency
(shifted towards the ‘red’ end of the spectrum). As most of the
galaxies we see are moving away from ours, this redshift effect is much more
common than a blueshift. The Doppler shift applies to radio waves and other
forms of radiation as well as to light. (It also applies to sound.)
dwarf star
A potentially misleading term that refers to stars of luminosity class V,
that is main sequence stars. Not to be confused with ‘white dwarfs’.
eclipsing binary
A binary system that is detected by the periodic eclipsing of each component
star by the other. The resultant light curve shows primary eclipses when the
dimmer star passes in front of the brighter star and a scondary eclipse or
minimum when the brighter star eclipses the dimmer star. The component stars
in an eclipsing binary are generally close to each other.
effective temperature Teff
The temperature of a blackbody that has same luminosity and size as a star.
In effect it represents the temeprature of the photosphere ('surface') of
a star. Expressed in Kelvin, K.
electron
A fundamental particle of matter. A lepton, it has a rest mass, me
of 9.109 x 10-31 kg and a charge, e of -1.602 x 10-19
C. Its antiparticle is the positron.
emission spectra
Also called "bright-line" spectra, these are produced by electrons de-exciting
and jumping back down to lower-energy orbits, emitting photons of specific
frequencies. These so-called emission lines appear as bright lines on a dark
background in photographic recordings or narrow peaks on an intensity plot.
Emission lines are produced by many astrophysical processes such as those
found in emission nebulae (including planetary nebulae and HII regions), quasars
and the some stars such as Wolf-Rayets.
exosolar planets (exoplanet)
Planets orbiting stars other than our Sun. To date only one has most likely
been directly imaged; most have been detected by their gravitational effect
on their star causing a periodic shift in the spectral lines of the star.
A few planets have also been detected by their transiting actross the face
of a star.
F spectral class
Stars with a 6,00 - 7,500 K effective temperature and a white-yellow colour.
Spectral characteristics are weak Ca+ lines and medium H Balmer
features. Examples include Procyon (F5 IV), the supergiant Canopus (F0 Ib)
and the main sequence star π3 Orionis.
galactic cluster
Another term for open cluster as they are typically located in the arms
of spiral galaxies where there is abundant dust and gas essential for star
formation.
Galileo
An Italian astronomer and scientist (1564 - 1642) who first systematically
used a telescope to study celestial objects and publish his findings. His
observations helped consolidate the Copernican concept of a heliocentric model.
He also made valuable contributions to the phsyics of motion.
galaxy
A huge collection of stars – often many thousands of millions –
and associated dust and gas. Galaxies are separated from each other by enormous
stretches of empty space. They may be spiral in shape (like a Catherine-wheel),
elliptical (like a football), or irregular. The galaxy we live in is referred
to as the Galaxy (or sometimes, the Milky Way Galaxy): it is a spiral galaxy,
about a hundred thousand light-years in diameter.
Gemini Observatories
Two 8.1m optical/near-infrared telescopes, one on Mauna Kea in Hawaii in
the northern hemisphere, the other in Cerro Panchon in Chile, in the southern
hemisphere. Australia is a partner in the seven nation international consortium
that owns and operates the telescopes.
globular cluster
Gravitationally-bound spherical clusters of densely-packed stars, normal
found in the halo of galaxies. Globular clusters contain thousands of stars,
maybe up to a million. Globular clusters contain old, highly-evolved Population
II stars that have low metallicities. A prominent southern hemisphere example
is 47 Tucane.
helium flash
The sudden onset of helium core fusion (or "burning") in post-main sequence
stars is called the helium flash. It occurs in stars with mass less than about
2-3 solar masses once post-main sequence hydrogen shell burning has dumped
sufficient helium nuclei into the core, heating it up to about 100 million
K. Once the temperature is hot enough for helium fusion in one part of the
core, the reaction quickly spreads throughout it due to the behaviour of the
electron degenerate gas, the whole process taking minutes or hours.
Hertzsprung – Russell (HR) diagram
An extremely useful diagram that plots luminosity (or Absolute magnitude)
on the vertical axis and spectral class, colour, colour index or effective
temperature along the horizontal axis. It shows that stars fall into several
main groups including the main sequence, giants, supergiants and white dwarfs.
Comparing stars on the diagram allows u to infer their properties and better
understand their evolutionary path.
Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
An Earth-orbiting optical, ultraviolet and near infrared space telescope
with a 2.4 m primary mirror. Launched in 1990 it continues to produce stunning
images and observations although its future is in doubt.
Hubble’s Law
The relationship discovered by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s that shows a linear
relationship bewteen the reshift of an non-local galaxy and its recessional
velocity. This means that the more distant a galaxy is from us, the faster
it is moving away from us . This was a key piece of evidence suggesting an
expanding Universe and supporting a Big Bang model.
hydrogen
The most abundant element in the Universe, its most common isotope has a
single electron orbiting a proton.. Atomic hydrogen formed from the decoupling
of electrons about 300,000 years after the Big Bang. It is the prime fuel
for nucleosynthesis in stars. Its fusion into helium is the source of energy
for main sequence stars such as our Sun.
hydrogen burning
The fusion of hydrogen (protons) to helium in the core or shells of stars.
Main sequence stars fuse hydrogen through the proton-proton chain or the CNO
cycle. It is a nuclear reaction and not 'burning' or combustion with oxygen.
a chemical reaction.
Instability strip
A region on the HR Diagram occupied by pulsating variable stars such as
Cepheids.
interferometry
Technique where light is collected by two or more separated collectors such
as radio antennas or telescope mirrors and then correlated. It is generally
used to improve the resolution of a source.
Kepler
A German scientist (1571-1630) who used Tycho Brahe's observations of planetary
motions to devise three empirical laws now known as Kepler's Laws of Planetary
Motion.
Kepler’s Laws
Kepler proposed three laws of planetary motion based on his analysis of
Tycho Brahe's long and detailed observations of the orbits of the planets.
The laws are:
The planets orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits, with the Sun as one
common focus.
The line between a planet and the Sun (the radius vector) sweeps out
equal areas in equal periods of time (sometimes called the Law of Equal
Areas).
The square of a planet's period, T, is directly proportional
to the cube of its average distance from the Sun, r:T2 ∝ r3. This law, the Law
of Periods or Harmonic Law also applies to other orbital systems from
the moons of Jupiter through to binary star systems. Astronomers use it
to calculate the masses of stars in binary systems.
light year
The distance light travels in a year: about 9,460,000 million kilometres
or 9.46 x 1015 m. (Light travels at 300 000 kilometres a second.)
1 parsec = 3.26 light years.
line spectra
Also called absorption spectra, these arise when photons of specific frequency
are absorbed by cooler gas, leaving a darker line on a background continuum
region. Most stellar spectra, including that from our Sun, are absorption
spectra.
luminosity L
This is the total power output of an object such as a star. The Sun’s
luminosity, LS = 4.0x1026W.
luminosity class
Stars of the same spectral class may vary widely in luminosity. This difference
is indicated by a roman letter after the spectral class; Ia and Ib- bright
supergiant and supergiant, II-bright giant, III-giant, IV-subgiant, V-main
sequence (dwarfs), VI-subdwarf and VII or wd-white dwarf. The Sun is thus
a G2 V star.
Main-sequence
The main grouping of stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. Main sequence
stars are characterised by core fusion of hydrogen to helium. The Sun is on
the main sequence. Stars spend the bulk of their lifespan on it.
metal
In astronomy a metal is any element heavier than Helium. This includes elements
such as Carbon and Oxygen. Stars with an abundance of metals are said to have
high metallicity.
meteor
The path made when a small particle of interplanetary dust entering our
atmsophere burns up.
meteorite
These are different. Meteors are small particles, usually smaller than grains
of sand, which travel through space: they become visible as ‘shooting
stars’ when they enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up as a result
of friction. Meteorites, on the other hand, are large enough to reach the
ground without being destroyed. Big ones produce craters.
Milky Way
The bright band of stars stretching across the night sky. It is actually
what we can see of our own Galaxy (we are looking at it from the inside, of
course.) Our Galaxy is sometimes called the Milky Way Galaxy. It is a barred
spiral galaxy.
nebula
An area of dust and gas in space. A nearby star can make a nebula shine,
either through reflected starlight, such as in the Pleiades, or because energy
from the star makes the nebula itself glow as in M42, the Great nebula in
Orion. Other types of nebulae are dark or absorption nebula such as the Coalsack,
planetary nebulae that are actually the ejected outer layers of a dying star
and supernova remnants.
neutrino
A fundamental particle. A neutral lepton, there are three, one each associated
with the elesctron, muon and tau particles. The mass of neutrinos is thought
to be either extremely small or zero. The interact extremely weakly with normal
matter. They are produced in fusion reactions in stellar interiors. The first
detection of neutrinos associated with an object from beyond our Sun was from
Supernova 1987A.
neutron
A neutral particle found in the nucleus of atoms heavier than hydrogen.
The rest mass of a neutron is slightly heavier than a proton. Free neutrons
are unstable and undergo beta decay to produce a proton, an electron and an
antineutrino with a mean lifetime of about 14 minutes. Neutrons are not fundamental
but are baryons. A neutron is composed of one up and two down quarks, giving
a net charge of zero.
neutron star
A giant ball of neutrons (particles found in the nuclei of atoms). Neutron
stars are very dense, only ten or twenty kilometres across, but more about
1.4 to 3 × the mass of our Sun. They are formed in supernova explosions.
nova
These are a type of cataclysmic variable caused charactrised by a brightening
of up to 10 magnitudes within several days. They are caused by a thermonuclear
eplosion of material that has accreted onto a white dwarf in a close binary
system. Unlike a supernova explosion the white dwarf remains after the explosion
and can accrete more material from its companion so that the process is repeated
after many thouands of years.
nucleosynthesis
Nucleosynthesis is the production of nuclei from lighter nuclei. Big bang
nucleosynthesis in the first few minutes of the Universe formed deuterium,
helium and traces of lithium nuclei from fusion of protons (hyrdrogen nuclei).
Stellar nucleosynthesis takes place in stars and is reponsible for production
of elements heavier than helium including carbon, oxygen and iron. It also
Very heavy nuclei are formed in the late evolutionary stages of more massive
stars including the final supernova explosion.
O spectral class
O-class stars are very hot with effective temperatures in the range of 28,000
- 50,000 K and thus appear blue. Their spectra are characterised by weak ionised
He+ lines and a strong UV continuum. Main sequence O stars are high mass,
20 - 60 & times; the at of the Sun and 9 - 15 × its radius. They are
extremely luminous, ranging from 90,000 - 800,000 × the Sun's luminosity
but have extremely short main sequence lifespans of only 1 - 10 million years.
Examples include Alnitak and Mintaka in Orion.
open cluster
An open cluster is a group of stars that are thought to have formed from
a common cloud of dust and gas. Open clusters are also known as galactic clusters
as they are generally located along the disk of spiral galaxies where star
formation is more common. Open clusters have a few dozen up to a few thousand
stars in a vloume up to 20 parsecs or so wide. They contain Population I stars,
young and high in metallicity. Open clisters are not gravitationally bound
so cluster members disperse into the general disk population of stars. Examples
include the Pleiades, Hyades, both in Taurus and the Jewel Box in Crux.
parsec pc
The distance in space at which an object would subtend a parallax angle
of 1 arc second from Earth. This corresponds to a distance of 3.08 x 1016
m or about 3.26 light years.
period-luminosity relationship
Several classes of pulsating variable stars such as Type I and II Cepheids
and RR-Lyrae stars exhibit a period-luminosity relatinship. The longer the
period of variability, the greater the intrinsic luminosity of the star. Astronomers
apply this relatinship to determine the ditance to such a star and hence also
the cluster or galaxy it is found in. Stars that obey a period-luminosity
relationship can be used as standard candles.
photographic magnitude
This is the apparent magnitude of a star as recoreded on a photographic
plate. As most photographic emulsions are more sensitive to blue light than
red light cooler, redder stars appear less bright when photographed than a
blue star. The photographic magnitude these days is ususally replaced by the
B magnitude which is the magnitude as recoreded through a B
or blue filter.
photon
The smallest ‘unit’ of electromagnetic radiation. The energy
of a photon is a function of its frequency and can be calculated from the
expression E = hf where h is Planck’s Constant (= 6.626 x 10-34 Js)
planet
A relatively small, speherical body that orbits a star , for instance, the
Earth. Note the definition of what constitutes a planet is currently under
heated discussion by astronomers and planetary scientists. For instance should
Pluto be regraded as a planet or be labelled as a Trans-Neptunian Object?
If Pluto is a planet should the recently discovered object 2003 UB313 that
is larger than Pluto but much further out also be regarded as a planet? (See
solar system.)
planetary nebula
A planetary nebula is the nebula formed in the AGB stage of a star's life
when it ejects its outer layers of gas. The exposed inner region of the star
left behind is initially so hot that the intense ultraviolet radiation it
emits ionises the expanding, ejected shell. This results in the cloud glowing,
similar to an emission nebula. Such objects are called planetary nebulae after
their initial description by Herschel in the 18th century. Through small telescopes
they appear as faint discs, like a dim planet though they are not related.
Planetary nebulae typically contain 0.1 - 0.2 solar masses at densities equivalent
to a vacuum on Earth. Spectacular images by modern telescopes including the
HST reveal a wide range of shapes that pose interesting problems for theorists
to explain.
Pre-main sequence stars
PMS
Stars not yet hot enough in their cores for hydrogen fusion to begin. Pre-Main
Sequence stars are protostars collapsing under gravity and heating up. They
would appear on a Hayashi track on the HR diagram.
population I star
Stars found in the spiral arms of galaxies, including our Sun, are generally
younger and have high metallicities. They are referred to as Population I
stars.
population II star
Population II stars are older, red stars with lower metallicities and are
typically located in globular clusters in galactic halos, in elliptical galaxies
and near the galactic centre of spiral galaxies.
proper motion
This is the shift of a star's (or other celestial object's) position across
the celestial sphere. Proper motion is measured in units of arcseconds per
year, ("/yr).
proton
A proton belongs to the hadron family of particles. It is composed of two
up quarks and one down quark, thus is a baryon. The charge on a proton is
the same magnitude as that of an electron but is positive. The rest mass of
a proton is 1.6726 × 10-27kg, about 1836 &times that of the
electron. Hydrogen nuclei are protons. The antiparticle of a proton is the
antiproton.
pulsar
A neutron star that puts out pulses of radio
energy. A pulsar is a neutron star that is emitting a beam of radio waves,
and spinning, and so the effect is like that of a lighthouse. Pulsars keep
exceptionally good time. Most of them ‘pulse’ at a rate between
ten times a second and once every three seconds; some spin around hundreds
of times a second. Pulsars have a mass of about 1.4 to 3 solar masses compacted
into a sphere about 10 km across.
quantum
The smallest ‘unit’ of energy. A quantum of light is called
a photon.
quark
Quarks are fundamental particles from which hadrons are formed. There are
six types of quarks; up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom. Each has a
spin of ½ and a charge of -1/3 or +2/3. Quarks are bound together through
the exchange of gluons. Each quark has a corresponding antiquark
as its antimatter particle.
quasar
Extremely distant, incredibly luminous objects. They are now generally accepted
to be the exceedingly bright centres of certain galaxies, tiny central cores
that put out the power of perhaps a thousand ordinary galaxies. The centre
of a quasar is thought to be a supermassive black hole of up to a billion
solar masses in a volume no larger than our solar system.
R
The apparent magnitude of a celestial object such as a star when measured
through an R filter. An R filter lets red light through.
radiation
The word ‘radiation’ has two different meanings, which can be
confusing. First, there is electromagnetic radiation. This is thought of as
travelling as ‘waves’ through space. Light, radio waves, X-rays,
infrared and ultraviolet rays are all kinds of electromagnetic radiation.
This is what astronomers are usually talking about when they refer to ‘radiation’.
Second, there is ‘ionising radiation’ – the radiation that
we associate with radioactive materials and nuclear power. Much of this is
actually sub-atomic particles: neutrons, protons and electrons. Gamma rays,
which are also produced by nuclear processes, can be thought of either as
‘ionising radiation’ or as a very short wavelength kind of electromagnetic
radiation.
radio telescope
A device for collecting the radio waves that are put out by objects in space
(such as individual stars, whole galaxies, supernova remnants, etc). Most
radio telescopes look like satellite communication dishes. You don’t
look through a radio telescope; instead, the radio waves are collected, turned
into electrical signals and then processed by computers. The end result is
usually a picture: like a photograph, but made with radio waves instead of
light.
rapid process (r-process)
During the final destruction of a high-mass star in a supernova explosion,
a high flux of neutrons is released as iron nuclei are ripped apart. These
neutrons can be captured by many of the heavy nuclei to produce other nuclei
in a method known as the r-process (r for rapid). The high number of neutrons
available in these few seconds can be captured by unstable nuclei before the
nuclei have had a chance to decay. In this way nuclei of elements such as
lead, gold and all the way up to uranium can be synthesised.
red giant
Red giants are post-main sequence stars on the Red Giant Branch of the HR
diagram. They have low effective temperatures, ~ 3,000 K (K or M spectral
class) so appear orange or reddish but have high luminosity, 102
to 103 × that of the Sun with luminosity class II or III.
Their radius is typically 100 × that of the earlier main sequence stage.
Red giants are have hydrogen shell burning and eventually helium core burning.
Aldebaran is a red giant.
red shift
When an object, such as a galaxy, is going away from you, the light it puts
out appears to become longer in wavelength – that is, shifted towards
the red (long) end of the spectrum. The faster the object is travelling away,
the greater degree of redshift. All galaxies (beyond our local group of galaxies)
show redshift, which indicates that the Universe as a whole is expanding.
Redshift applies to radio waves, and other wavelengths, as well as to light.
It is a special case of the Doppler shift.
reflection nebula
This type of nebula is associated with hot, young stars, typically B2 or
hotter. Dust in the cloud scatters light from the star so that it appears
blueish to an observer. The classic example of a reflection nebula is that
surrounding the Pleiades cluster.
resolution
The higher the resolution of a telescope, the more details we can see from
the images obtained on it. Technically we are referring here to the spatial
or angular resolution of a telescope. For circular apertures, such
as in telescopes, where the light rays from a source are parallel, as is the
case for distant point sources of light such as stars, the light will be diffracted
so as to form an Airy disc. The circular diffraction pattern formed contains
84% of the light in the central bright spot with decreasing percentages in
the surrounding bright rings. The first diffraction ring should have less
than 2% of the light in the central Airy disc. Two objects are said to be
resolved if their Airy discs are sufficiently separated to be seen as distinct.
resolving power
The ability of a telescope to distinguish between close, but separate, objects
or features.
sensitivity
Sensitivity is a measure of the minimum signal that a telescope can distinguish
above the random background noise. All other things being equal, a telescope
of larger primary mirror or lens is more sensitive than one with a smaller
primary.
Solar System
The Sun and other bodies associated with it: the nine planets (Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) and their
moons, as well as comets, asteroids and dust and gas.
spectral class
Stars can be classified according to key characteristics in their spectra,
mainly the presence and strength of spectral lines. The main spectral classes,
in sequence from hottest to coolest are: O, B,
A, F, G, K,
M. Each class is further subdivided into ten subdivisions
from 0(hottest) to 9 (coolest). Our Sun is a G2 star.
spectral lines
Molecules (and individual atoms) can exist in different energy states. When
a molecule jumps from a high energy state to a lower one, it puts out energy.
This energy takes the form of a burst of light or radio waves or other kinds
of radiation. The size of the jump determines the frequency of the radiation.
Each molecule can only make jumps of certain sizes; as a result, it puts out
radiation only of certain frequencies. These frequencies are called spectral
lines. Each kind of molecule can be recognised by its own particular patterns
of spectral lines – they form a ‘signature’. By looking
for spectral lines, astronomers have found many different kinds of molecules
(such as water and many carbon-based molecules) in space.
spectrograph
A spectrograph is an instrument used to obtain and record an astronomical
spectrum. The spectrograph splits or disperses the light from an object into
its component wavelengths so that it can be recorded then analysed. Modern
multifibre spectrographs as the 2dF on the AAT allow hundreds of individual
spectra from stars or galaxies to be obtained simultaneously.
spectroscopic binary
A binary system detected by Doppler shifts in its spectral lines is called
a spectroscopic binary. Analysis of the spectral line shifts versus time reveals
information about the radial velocities of the component stars. In spectroscopic
binaries the component stars are often very close and may in fact exchange
material due to tidal interactions. Orbital periods range from a few hours
to months, with separations of much less than an AU in many cases. The first
spectroscopic binary detected was Mizar A.
spectroscopic parallax
Spectroscopic parallax uses the spectral classification and luminosity of
a star (obtained from photometric observations) to place it on an HR diagram.
By then comparing the apparent magnitude with the expected absolute magnitude
a distance to the star can be estimated.
standard candle
star
A large ball of gas, mostly hydrogen, held together by gravity. Stars produce
their energy through nuclear reactions: in normal stars, hydrogen is being
converted to helium, and this process releases energy. Our Sun is a very ordinary
kind of star: it is about five thousand million years old, and will keep going
for about another five thousand million years.
stellar evolution
Standard candles are celestial objects with known luminosities. This allows
them to be used as distance indicators as their distance can be inferred by
comparing their apparemnt and absolute magnitudes. Examples include Type Ia
supernovae and Cepheids.
super giant
These are the largest, brightest stars known. Of luminosity classes I, they
are found along the top of the HR diagram and have evolved from high-mass
main sequence stars (> about 11 solar masses). They are short-lived and
will eventually explode as a supernova. Examples include Rigel, Deneb and
Betelgeuse.
supernova
SN
The explosion of a star at the end of its life . Not all stars explode,
only those about ten to twenty times more massive than our Sun. A supernova
creates the elements that are heavier than iron (such as gold, silver and
most of the other metals).
supernova remnant
SNR
The debris left by a supernova. Supernova remnants can often be seen by
radio telescopes. Some are detectable thousands of years after the original
star exploded.
surface temperature
(see effective temperature)
T Tauri stars
T Tauri stars are young, irregular, variable stars. They are protostars
of 3 solar masses or less, still collapsing and undergoing mass-loss. This
material is ejected into space at speeds up to 500,000 km h-1 at
a rate of 10-7 to 10-8 solar masses per year. The T
Tauri phase may last 10 million years during which a mass equal to the Sun
is ejected. Spectral analysis shows that these stars rotate rapidly and have
high abundances of lithium, an element that is consumed early in a star's
life. They are located just to the right of the main sequence on an HR diagram.
trigonometric parallax
Nearby celestial objects exhibiti a perioidic shift in position relative
to background stars due to the earth's motion around the Sun. By measuring
this stellar parallax and applying trigonometry the distance to the nearby
star can be determined. This method is used to define the parsec.
ultraviolet
UV
Part of the electromagnetic spectrum between the visible and X-ray regions.
Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed in our atmosphere so UV telescopes such
as FUSE need to be placed in space.
variable star
A variable star is simply one whose brightness (or other physical property
such as radius or spectral type) changes over time. Intrinsic variables are
those in which the change in brightness is due to some change within the star
itself such as in pulsating stars like the Cepheids. Extrinsic variables are
those in which the light output changes due to some process external to the
star itself. The most common example of these are the eclipsing binaries.
visual binary
A binary system in which component star can be visually resolved through
a telescope. Examples include α Cen and β Cru.
visual magnitude
V
The magnitude of an object as measured through a V filter. This
approximates the peak response of the human eye thus is often referred to
a
visual.
white dwarf
White dwarfs (luminosity class wd) are the hot, compact, collapsed remains
of stars that have exhausted their core fusion. They are about the size of
the Earth but with the mass of the Sun hence are extremely dense. Electron
degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse.
White dwarfs are very hot but dim due to their small surface area.
X-ray
X-ray radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum between the UV and
gamma-ray components. As X-rays are blocked by our atmosphere X-ray astronomy
is only possible from space such as with the Chandra telescope. X-ray emissions
are associated with high-energy astrophysical events such as accretion onto
neutron stars and black holes.
zero-age main sequence
ZAMS
This is the position of a zero-age star when it arrives on the main sequence. It is used to infer the age of cluster stars.
