xiPreface
January 31, 1958 marked a significant beginning for space exploration. More than the historic and successful launch of Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite, it was the beginning of an unprecedented era of exploration and understanding of our own planet and the distant worlds beyond. The more 
we uncover about the mysteries and beauty of space, the more we are inspired to go farther. Yet, 
with all we have learned, we still cannot even imag-ine what future generations will find.Spacecraft from NASA and others have shown us the intricacies within clouds and terrain of dis-tant planets that were only a dot in an astronomer™s 
telescope a few decades ago. We have seen the 
birth of stars, black holes, and found exoplanets orbiting stars in systems remarkably similar to ours. 
Future missions will take us forward in history, as 
we seek to uncover the very origins of our universe.
We may not know precisely whatŠor whoŠwe 
will find out there, but we can be sure that space exploration will continue to surprise and inspire us, 
as it did for those who came before and those who will follow. Along the way there will be missteps, 
some more devastating than others. That is the price of doing what™s never been done beforeŠa 

price that sometimes is tragically paid at the high
-est cost by the courageous. But like those early 
days of the space program, we are as motivated 
to succeed by the missions that do not make it as 
those that do. And we learn from them, coming 
back stronger and smarter.
In this book, the history of NASA™s six decades 
of exploration beyond Earth and its Moon to other planets and their moons is laid out. The story fol
-lows spacecraft to the Sun, comets, minor and 
dwarf planets and, ultimately, beyond our solar 
system. As we marvel at the ingenuity of the early 
pioneers of the Space Age, we realize how much 
they achieved with what, comparatively, was so 
little. Computers were human, and when the machines did take over calculations, they also took 
up entire rooms with processing capability less than smartphones in your pockets today.
Yet some of NASA™s greatest achievements 
took place during this period: Mariner IV, which 
took the first pictures of the surface of Mars 
in 1965; the global view of Mars from Mariner 9 in 1971; and the Viking landers of the 1970s, 
which executed the first planetary soft-landings of American spacecraft. The crowning achievements of America™s mid-century robotic space exploration 
were the Pioneer and Voyager missions which were 
sent to the far boundaries of our solar system using early 1970s technology. As this is being written, 
Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continue to send us data 
from beyond the outer planets from the boundary region of the Sun™s sphere of influence, the helio
-sphere. But space does not belong to the United States alone. We have evolved from the earliest 
days of the Space Race, when being ﬁfirstﬂ brought serious geopolitical consequences, to our current era of international partnerships that have taken us 
farther together than we could have gone alone.In the modern era of exploration, which itself will look outdated in a generation, we have discov-ered the extraordinary rings and moons of Saturn with NASA™s Cassini spacecraft and the Huygens 
lander built by the European Space Agency. We 
marvel at images of the swirling storms on Jupiter sent back to Earth by our Juno mission. And we 
constantly find new science from the Curiosity rover that™s been trekking across the surface of 
Mars for more than five years.Our robotic emissaries have made tremendous 
journeys over the past six decades. They carry the 
vision and inspiration of humankind beyond our xiiBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
physical ability to make the tripŠyet. This book 
celebrates the extraordinary men and women who 
have looked up and wondered what™s out there and 
then found the answer. In only 60 years, our tech
-nology has evolved from a simple, modified Geiger counter launched into Earth orbit to sublime tech-nologies sending full-color, high-resolution images 
and data from the edge of the universe. The next 60 should be exponentially rewarding.Œ  Dr. Thomas H. Zurbuchen
 NASA Associate Administrator  at Science Mission DirectoratexiiiIntroduction
Humans abandoned their nomadic habits and 
moved into settlements about 40 to 50 thou-sand years ago. We have been using tools even 

longer. But our ability to send one of our tools 

into the heavens is of much more recent origin, 

spanning only the past 60 years. Yet, in that time, 

we have created new toolsŠwe call them robotic 

spacecraftŠand sent them into the cosmos, far 

beyond Earth. Of course, many never got very far. 

That™s the cost of hubris and ambition. But most 

did. And many never came back to Earth and never 

will. In that sense, we as a species have already 

left a mark on the heavens; these small objects 

that dot the cosmos are a permanent legacy of our 

species, existing for millions of years, even if we 

as a planet were to disappear. This book that you 

hold in your hands (or are reading in digital form) 

is a chronicle of all these tools, both failed and 

successful, that humans have flung into the heav-ens beyond Earth.The text in front of you is a completely updated and revised version of a monograph published in 
2002 by the NASA History Office under the orig
-
inal title Deep Space Chronicle: A Chronology of 
Deep Space and Planetary Probes, 1958Œ2000. This new edition not only adds all events in robotic deep 
space exploration after 2000 and up to the end of 
2016, but it also completely corrects and updates 

all accounts of missions from prior years. The infor-mation in the monograph is current as of mid-2017 
when I completed writing.What Does This Publication Include?
This monograph contains brief descriptions of all 
robotic deep space missions attempted by humans 
since the opening of the space age in 1957. The 
missions are listed chronologically in order of their 
launch dates (i.e., not their target body encounters). Different people have different criteria for which 

kind of spacecraft to include in a list of ﬁdeep space 
probes.ﬂ In the list that follows, I have included all 
spacecraft that satisfied the following˛guidelines:1. Any probe that was launched to an ﬁencounterﬂ 
with a ﬁtarget.ﬂa.
 An ﬁencounterﬂ includes the following events:i. flybysii. orbitingiii. atmospheric entry and impactsiv.
 soft-landingb. ﬁTargetsﬂ include the following:
i. the planets of the Solar System (Mercury
, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, 

and Neptune)ii. the Earth™s Moon
iii. minor planets or asteroidsiv.
 natural satellites of the planets and asteroidsv.
 cometsvi. dwarf planets (such as Pluto)2. Any probe that was deliberately sent into helio-centric (solar) orbit.3. Any probe that was sent into a halo (Lissajous) 
orbit around any of the libration points involv-ing Earth, the Moon, and the Sun.4. Any probe that was launched as part of a science, lunar, or planetary program to at least lunar dis
-
tance in order to simulate a deep space trajec-tory (such as, for example, Geotail, Zond˛4, and 

a few early Surveyor Model mockups).I have included probes whether they succeeded in 
their objectives or not. Thus, some probes never 
got a few meters beyond the launch pad while 
others are heading into the outer reaches of the 

solar system.xivBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
It should be noted that the criteria for inclu
-sion in this volume does not always coincide with NASA™s own programmatic distinctions about what 
constitutes a planetary science mission. For exam
-ple, this volume includes missions such as Wind, 
ACE, MAP, and SIRTF, none of which was funded 

through NASA™s solar system exploration line. 
The criteria for inclusion here is simply whether the mission was intended to operate beyond Earth orbit and satisfied the above four requirements, 
regardless of who funded it or what kind of science it˛generated.Where Is the Information From?
For statistical data on U.S. probes (such as launch 
vehicle numbers, launch times, list of instruments, 

etc.), I have used original NASA sources such as 
Public Affairs releases, press kits, postflight mis
-sion reports, and official histories. These records 
are deposited in the NASA Historical Reference 

Collection at NASA Headquarters in Washington, 
DC, or are available online at various NASA or 
government databases. For missions after approx
-imately 2000, there is a proliferation of official 

mission websites, hosted by the organization 
sponsoring the missions, including, for example, 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Applied 

Physics Laboratory (APL), and the S. A. Lavochkin 

Scientific-Production Association (or NPO imeni 
Lavochkina). I have used these as primary sources 
of information. For some of the initial Earth orbital 

parameters of many deep space probes, a very useful 

source has been the online newsletter ﬁJonathan™s 
Space Reportﬂ prepared by Jonathan McDowell.For Soviet/Russian sources, I have used only 
Russian-language sources, such as the journal Kosmicheskaya issledovaniya (Space Research), 
official organizational histories, reliable memoirs, or the semi-official journal Novosti kosmonavtiki (News of Cosmonautics).In the bibliography at the end of the mono-graph, I list a few published secondary sources 
that have been useful in verifying or framing data. 
Every attempt has been made to present accurate 
information, but with a project of this size and 
scope, there will naturally be errors.I have avoided as much as possible using unof-ficial amateur Web sites (such as Wikipedia) or 
secondary history books, such as Andrew Wilson™s 
otherwise quite wonderful Solar System Log. These sources are good for a quick overview but they often 
reproduce errors (especially in timings, details, and distances) that have now been repeatedly and erro-neously propagated in the Internet era. The one exception is Don Mitchell™s excellent website on 

Soviet lunar and planetary exploration, found at 
http://mentallandscape.com/V_Venus.htm
. I highly recommend it.What Kind of Information Have I 
Included?In terms of the mission descriptions, I have kept the focus on dynamic mission events (course correc-
tions, orbital insertion, reentry, landing, equipment 
deployment, etc.) rather than mission planning or scientific results, although in many cases I have 
included brief summaries of both. But I do not 
make any claim to comprehensiveness in terms of the scientific outcomes of the missions. This monograph is more about what happened rather than what was discovered. In the interest of space, 
the mission descriptions have been kept relatively short, filled with detail, and to the point.Conflicting Information
There are many, many areas where different sources 
have supplied different information, especially for 
some early Soviet probes launched between 1960 and 1965. The precise instrument complement of these probes (1M, 1V, 2MV, and 3MV series) is not 

known very well because in many cases, scientific 
instruments that were meant for the spacecraft were removed before launch. I have listed all the originally slated instruments meant for those vehi-cles even if they were later removed before launch. 
Undoubtedly, there are mistakes and inconsisten
-cies in the lists presented here but I have made 
every effort to be as accurate as possible.xvA Note About Terminology
Mission DesignationsI have made every attempt to use the names of spacecraft and missions that were contempora-neous to the time of the mission and assigned by the 
agency or organization implementing the˛missions.In the 1960s, NASA routinely used Roman numerals for missions (Mariner IV, Mariner V, etc.) 
in their official documentation, but these were dis-continued in the 1970s. Readers will note that I 
have used this convention for all missions until and 
including 1970 but after that switched to Latin 

numbers (Mariner 9, Mariner 10, etc.). This divi-sion is somewhat arbitrary but was necessary not to 
confuse readers.The practice of giving spacecraft ﬁofficialﬂ names is complicated by the fact that beginning with the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and until the late 1980s, the Soviet Union never announced or 
acknowledged a mission if it failed to reach Earth 

orbit. In addition, for those lunar and planetary probes that did reach Earth orbit but failed to leave it, the Soviets adopted two strategies:Ł between 1960 and 1963, the Soviets simply never admitted their existence and made no announcement; andŁ beginning November 1963, the Soviet media began to give these stranded-in-Earth-orbit 
spacecraft ﬁKosmosﬂ numbers. So, the deep 
space vehicle launched on 11 November 1963 that reached Earth orbit but failed to leave for deep space was simply given the ﬁnextﬂ Kosmos 
number, in this case ﬁ21.ﬂ By giving it such a 

nondescript name (ﬁKosmos 21ﬂ), Soviet offi
-cials sought to draw attention away from such 
failures. This practice was followed well into 

the late 1980s.For both of these three types of missions, I have 

used the following convention:[Program, Spacecraft design designation, serial number]OR
Kosmos number [Program]I do not use terms such as ﬁMarsnik 1ﬂ or ﬁMars 1960Aﬂ (listed in the National Space Science Data Center, for example, to denote the spacecraft 

launched on 10 October 1960). Since the Soviets never used such names, it would be entirely inac-curate to ascribe such designations. Such fictitious names (such as ﬁSputnik 27ﬂ) unfortunately prolif-erate online but are Western inventions.
Launch Sites
For Soviet and Russian launch sites, the following 

conventions apply:ﬁSite A / Bﬂ implies that the probe was launched 
from Site A, Launch Unit B
Mission GoalsThere are good reasons not to use terms such as 
ﬁflybyﬂ or ﬁflightﬂ since spacecraft do not fly. As 

one of the reviewers for this manuscript pointed out, these terms are remnants of the era of aero-nautics. As such, more appropriate terms would 
be ﬁswingbyﬂ (instead of ﬁflybyﬂ) and ﬁmissionﬂ 
(instead of ﬁflightﬂ). However, because terms 
such as ﬁflybyﬂ and ﬁflightﬂ are still widely used by many space agencies globally, this manuscript has 

retained their use, despite their imprecise nature.xviiAcknowledgments

Launch Vehicle: 
Thor Able 1 (Thor no. 127)
Launch Date and Time: 
17 August 1958 / 12:18 UT
Launch Site: Cape Canaveral / Launch Complex 17A
Scientific Instruments:1. magnetometer2. micrometeoroid detector3. 2 temperature sensors4. TV cameraResults: On 27 March 1958, the U.S. Department of 
Defense announced the launch of four to five lunar 
probes later in the year, all under the supervision of 
the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) as 
part of scientific investigations during the Interna-tional Geophysical Year. Of these, one or two (later 
confirmed as two) would be carried out by the Army™s 
Ballistic Missile Agency and the other three by the 
Air Force™s Ballistic Missile Division. This launch 
was the first of three Air Force attempts, and the first 
attempted deep space launch by any country. The 
Able 1 spacecraft, a squat conical fiberglass struc-ture built by Space Technology Laboratories (STL), 
carried a crude infrared TV scanner. The simple 
thermal radiation device carried a small parabolic 
mirror for focusing reflected light from the lunar 
surface onto a cell that would transmit voltage pro-portional to the light it received. Engineers painted 
a pattern of dark and light stripes on the spacecraft™s 
outer surface to regulate internal temperature. 
The spacecraft was also disinfected with ultravio-let light prior to launch. The launch vehicle was a 
three-stage variant of the Thor intermediate range 
ballistic missile (IRBM) with elements appropri-ated from the Vanguard rocket used on its second 
and third stages. The entire project involved 3,000 
people from 52 scientific and industrial firms, all 
but 6 of which were located in southern California. 
According to the ideal mission profile, Able 1 was 
designed to reach the Moon™s vicinity 2.6 days after 
launch following which the TX-8-6 solid propellant 
motor would fire to insert the payload into orbit 
around the Moon. Orbital altitude would have been 
29,000 kilometers with an optimal lifetime of about 
two weeks. The actual mission, however, lasted only 
73.6 seconds, the Thor first stage having exploded 
at an altitude of 15.2 kilometers altitude. Telemetry 
was received from the payload for at least 123 sec-onds after the explosion, probably until impact in 
the Atlantic. Investigators concluded that the acci
-dent had been caused by a turbopump gearbox fail-ure. The mission was not named at the time but has 
been retroactively known as ﬁPioneer 0.ﬂ2[Luna, Ye-1 no. 1]

 (upper stage):1. sodium vapor experiment2. scintillation counterResults: The Soviet government approved a modest plan for initial exploration of the Moon in March 1958. Engineers conceived of four initial probes, the Ye-1 (for lunar impact), Ye-2 (to photograph 
the farside of the Moon), Ye-3 (to photograph the 
farside of the Moon with advanced imaging equip-ment), and Ye-4 (lunar impact with a nuclear explo
-sion). The Ye-1 was a simple probe, a pressurized 
spherical object made from aluminum-magne
-sium alloy slightly bigger than the first Sputnik. The goals were to detect the magnetic field of the Moon, study the intensity and variation of cosmic rays, record photons in cosmic rays, detect lunar radiation, study the distribution of heavy nucleii in primary cosmic radiation, study the gas component of interplanetary matter, study corpuscular solar 
radiation, and record the incidence of meteoric particles. The Blok Ye upper stage (with the 8D714 
engine) carried additional instrumentation, includ-ing radio transmitters and one kilogram of sodium 
to create an artificial comet on the outbound tra
-jectory that could be photographed from Earth. During the first Ye-1 launch, at T+87 seconds, the 
launch vehicle™s strapon boosters began to develop 
longitudinal resonant vibrations. The rocket even-tually disintegrated at T+93 seconds, destroying its payload. The problem was traced to violent pres-sure oscillations in the combustion chamber of one of the strapon booster engines. This generated a resonant frequency vibration throughout the frame causing it to shake violently. A fix was proposed 
by reducing the thrust at T+85 seconds when the rocket reached maximum dynamic pressure.3Able 2 [Pioneer]Nation: USA (2)

Launch Site: Cape Canaveral / Launch Complex 17A
Scientific Instruments:1. ion chamber2. magnetometer3. micrometeoroid detector4. TV camera5. 2 temperature sensorsResults: Although the USAF actually conducted the mission, this was the first U.S. space mission technically under the aegis of the recently formed 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA). The spacecraft was very similar in design to the Able 1 probe and like its predecessor, built by 
Space Technology Laboratories (STL). The probe 
was designed to record micrometeoroid impacts, take magnetic field and radiation measurements, 
and obtain a ﬁfacsimile image of the surface of the moon.ﬂ During the launch, the Thor second stage shut down 10 seconds early due to incorrect infor-mation from an accelerometer measuring incre
-mental velocity. The launch vehicle thus imparted 
insufficient velocity for the probe to escape Earth™s 
gravity. An attempt to insert the spacecraft into 
high Earth orbit at 128,700 × 32,200 kilometers by using its Thiokol-built retromotor failed because 
internal temperatures had fallen too low for the batteries to provide adequate power. The probe 
did, however, reach an altitude of 114,750 kilo
-meters (according to NASA information from Feb
-ruary 1959) by 11:42 UT on launch day, verifying 
the existence of the Van Allen belts and returning 
71958
 other useful data on the boundary of the geomag-netic cavity. It reentered 43 hours 17 minutes after 
launch. Investigators later concluded that an accel
-erometer had mistakenly cut off the Able stage 
because of an incorrect setting of a valve. In a press 

release on October 11 soon after the launch, the 
U.S. Department of Defense officially bestowed the name ﬁPioneerﬂ to the probe, although it has often been retroactively known as ﬁPioneer 1.ﬂ The 

name was apparently suggested not by any NASA 
official but by one Stephen A. Saliga, an official in 
charge of Air Force exhibits at Wright-Patterson Air 
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, who designed a dis
-play to coincide with the launch.Thor-Able I with the Pioneer I spacecraft atop, prior to

Scientific Instruments:1. ionization chamber2. magnetometer3. temperature sensors4. micrometeoroid sensor5. proportional counter telescope6. TV systemResults: This was the second official NASA deep space launch although operations on the ground were handled by the Air Force. For this third launch 
of an STL-built lunar orbiter, engineers introduced 
a number of changes to the Thor Able launcher. 
The probe also now included a new TV scanner and 
a new type of battery, as well as a new cosmic ray 
telescope to study the Cherenkov Effect. Pioneer 
II, like its predecessors, never reached its target. A 
signal from the ground shut down the Thor launch vehicle™s second stage earlier than planned. Addi
-tionally, when the X-248 third stage engine sepa
-rated, it failed to fire. As a result, the probe burned 
up in Earth™s atmosphere only 42 minutes 10 sec
-onds after launch at 28.6° E longitude. During its brief mission, it reached an altitude of 1,530 kilo
-meters (as announced in December 1959) and sent back data that suggested that Earth™s equatorial 
region had higher flux and energy levels than previ-ously thought. The information also indicated that 
micrometeoroid density was higher near Earth than in space. Investigators concluded that the third stage engine had failed to fire because of a broken wire. A NASA press release from Administrator T. 
Keith Glennan (1905Œ1995) soon after the launch officially named the probe ﬁPioneer II.ﬂ6[Luna, Ye-1 no. 3]

(8D75) of the R-7 booster dropped abruptly at 
T+245.4 seconds to about 70% of optimal levels, 
leading to premature engine cutoff. The payload 
never reached escape velocity. Later investiga
-tion showed that a pressurized seal in the hydro-gen peroxide pump of the main engine had lost 
integrity in vacuum conditions. The malfunction 
caused the main turbine to cease working and thus 
led to engine failure.7Pioneer IIINation: USA (4)

91958
 Results: This was the first of two U.S. Army launches 
to the Moon, subsequent to three attempts by the Air Force. Pioneer III was a spin-stabilized probe 
(up to 400 rpm) whose primary goal was to fly by the Moon. Two special 6-gram weights were to be 
spun out on 1.5-meter wires to reduce spin to 6 rpm once the mission was under way. The space
-craft carried an optical sensor to test a future imag-ing system. If the sensor received a collimated 
beam of light from a source (such as the Moon) that was wide enough to pass through the lens and fall simultaneously on two photocells, then the sensor would send a signal to switch on the imaging system (which was actually not carried on this spacecraft). Unfortunately, the main booster 
engine shut down 4 seconds earlier than planned due to premature propellant depletion. Once put on its trajectory, it was determined that Pioneer III 
was about 1,030 km/hour short of escape veloc-ity. It eventually reached a maximum altitude of 
102,322 kilometers and subsequently plummeted and burned up over Africa 38 hours 6 minutes 
after launch. In addition, the de-spin mechanism failed to operate, preventing the test of the optical system. The radiation counters, however, returned 
important data. Dr. William H. Pickering (1910Œ
2004), in a paper presented to an IGY Symposium on 29 December 1958, noted that ﬁ[w]hile the results of the launch were disappointing – the div-idend of radiation measurements of the Van Allen 
belt gained as the payload returned to earth were of great value in defining this energy field.ﬂ This data contributed to the major scientific discovery of dual bands of radiation around˜Earth.Pioneer III being assembled by technicians.

-tually passed by the Moon at a distance of 6,400 kilometers about 34 hours following launch at 02:59 UT on January 4. (Some sources say the 
range was as high as 7,500 kilometers). Before the lunar encounter, at 00:57 UT on 3 January 1959 
the attached upper stage released one kilogram of sodium at a distance of 113,000 kilometers from Earth which was photographed by Soviet ground-based astronomers although the quality of the images was poor, partly due to poor weather con
-ditions. Ground controllers lost contact with the Soviet Space Rocket (retroactively named ﬁLuna˜1ﬂ 
in 1963) approximately 62 hours after launch due to loss of battery power when the payload was 597,000 kilometers from Earth, after which the probe became the first spacecraft to enter orbit around the Sun.9Pioneer IVNation: USA (5)

Results: This was the last of 5 American lunar

officially ended a few months prior). Its design was 
very similar to Pioneer III; a key difference was 
the addition of a ﬁmonitorﬂ to measure the voltage 
12BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
of the main radio transmitter, which had failed for 
unknown reasons on Pioneer III. A de-spin mecha
-nism was on board to slow the spin-stabilized vehi-cle from its initial spin of 480 rpm down to about 
11 rpm about 11 hours after launch. Although it 
did not achieve its primary objective to photo-graph the Moon during a flyby, Pioneer IV became 
the first U.S. spacecraft to reach Earth escape 
velocity. During the launch, the Sergeants on the 
second stage did not cut off on time, causing the 
azimuths and elevation angles of the trajectory to 
change. The spacecraft thus passed by the Moon 
at a range of about 60,000 kilometers (instead of 
the planned 32,000 kilometers), i.e., not close 
enough for the imaging scanner to function. 
Closest approach was at 10:24 UT on 4˜March 
1959, about 41 hours after launch. Its tiny radio 
transmitted information for 82 hours before con-tact was lost at a distance of 655,000 kilometers 
from EarthŠthe greatest tracking distance for a 
human-made object to date. The probe eventu
-ally entered heliocentric orbit becoming the first 
American spacecraft to do so. Scientists received 
excellent data that suggested that the intensity of 
the upper belt of the Van Allen belts had changed 
since Pioneer III (probably attributable to a recent 
solar flare) and that there might be a third belt at a 
higher altitude to the others.10[Luna, Ye-1A no. 5]

originally scheduled for 16 June but had to be postponed for two days due to the negligence of a 
young lieutenant who inadvertently permitted fuel
-ing of the upper stage with the wrong propellant. During the actual launch, one of the gyroscopes of the inertial guidance system failed at T+153 sec-onds, and the wayward booster was subsequently destroyed by command from the ground.11Second Soviet Space Rocket [Luna 2]

clearly visible from the ground. This sixth attempt at lunar impact was much more accurate than its 
predecessors; the spacecraft successfully impacted the surface of the Moon at 21:02:23 UT on 
14˜September 1959, thus becoming the first object 
of human origin to make contact with another celestial body. The Blok Ye upper stage impacted 
about 30 minutes later, also at a velocity of just over 
3 kilometers/second. The probe™s impact point was 
approximately at 30° N / 0° longitude on the slope of the Autolycus crater, east of Mare Serenitatis. 
Luna 2 (as it was called after 1963) deposited 
Soviet emblems on the lunar surface carried in 9 × 15-centimeter sized metallic spheres. The 
spacecraft™s magnetometer measured no signifi

These were the first measurements of physical fields for celestial bodies other than Earth. The ion traps on board Luna 2 made the first in situ measurements of the extended plasma envelope of Earth, suggesting the existence of what was later called the plasmapause.12

Results: This spacecraft, of the Ye-2A class, was the 
first Soviet probe designed to take pictures of the farside of the Moon using the Yenisey unit (using 
the AFA-Ye1 camera), which consisted of two 
lenses of 200 mm (wide angle) and 500 mm (high 
resolution) focal lengths, and a capacity to read up 

to 40 images on a 35 mm film roll. The dual lenses exposed adjacent frames simultaneously. It was 
also the first spacecraft to be fully powered by solar 
panels. Strictly speaking, the probe was not meant 
to reach Earth escape velocity; instead, the launch vehicle inserted the spacecraft, called the Auto
-matic Interplanetary Station (Avtomaticheskaya 

mezhplanetnaya stantsiya, AMS) in the Soviet press, 

into a highly-elliptical orbit around Earth at 48,280 × 468,300 kilometers, sufficient to reach lunar distance. During the coast to the Moon, the AMS 

suffered overheating problems and poor commu-nications, but the vehicle eventually passed over the Moon™s southern polar cap at a range of 7,900 
kilometers at 14:16 UT on 6 October before climb-ing up (northward) over the Earth-Moon plane. At 
a distance of 65,200 kilometers from the Moon at 03:30 UT on 7 October, having been properly ori
-ented by its Chayka attitude control system (the 
first successful 3-axis stabilization used on a space-craft), the twin-lens 35 mm camera began taking the first of 29 pictures of the farside of the Moon. This session lasted a total of about 40 minutes, by 
the end of which the spacecraft was 68,400 kilo-meters from the lunar surface. The exposed film was then developed, fixed, and dried automati-cally, following which a special light-beam of up to 
1,000 lines per image scanned the film for trans-mission to Earth. Images were received the next day (after a few aborted attempts) at two locations, a primary at Simeiz in Crimea known as IP-41Ye 

and a backup in the Soviet far east, at Yelizovo in 

Kamchatka, known as NIP-6. On the ground, there 
were two systems for recording the images from 151959

AMS, Yenisey I (fast mode, at 50 lines/second) and 
Yenisey II (at slow mode at 0.8 lines/second). Sev
-enteen of the images were of usable quality, and for 
the first time, they showed parts of the Moon never before seen by human eyes. The trajectory of AMS 

was specifically designed so that images would 
show at least half of the Moon, one-third of which was on the near side, so as to provide a point of reference for evaluating formations on the farside. 
Controllers were unable to regain contact with the 

spacecraft after the spacecraft entered and then exited Earth™s shadow. Luna 3 circled Earth at least 
11 times and probably reentered sometime in early 

1960. Post-Cold War revelations confirmed that 

the film type used on AMS, known as ﬁAShﬂ by 
the Soviets, was actually unexposed film that was repurposed from a CIA reconnaissance balloon 
(from Project Genetrix) that had drifted into Soviet 
territory in the late 1950s. This film had been stored at the A. F. Mozhayskiy Military Academy 
in Leningrad when the space camera manufactur-ers at the VNII-380 institute had stumbled upon 16BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
it. Further investigation showed that the tempera-ture-resistant and radiation-hardened film would 
be perfect for the AFA-Ye1 camera, and the rest 
was history. The spacecraft, named Luna 3 after 
1963, photographed about 70% of the farside and found fewer mare areas on the farside, prompting scientists to revise their theories of lunar evolution.13Able IVB [Pioneer]Nation: USA (6)

mission planners had redirected their missions after the success of the Soviet Automatic Interplanetary 
Station (ﬁLuna 3ﬂ) mission. All the scientific exper
-iments and internal instrumentation were powered by Nickel-Cadmium batteries charged from 1,100 solar cells on four paddles which made the vehicle resemble the recently-launched Explorer VI. The imaging system, the same one used on Explorer VI, comprised a tiny 1.13-kilogram scanning device 
developed by STL that was ﬁto be used in [an] attempt to get a crude outline of the moon™s surface 
if the probe achieve[d] lunar orbit.ﬂ Each probe 
also carried a hydrazine monopropellant tank with two thrust chambers (each 9 kgf), one of which was for lunar orbit insertion at a range of 8,000 kilo-meters from the Moon. Ideal lunar orbital param-eters were planned as 6,400 × 4,800 kilometers. The mission also inaugurated the first use of the 
Atlas-with-an-upper-stage combination, affording 
increased payload weight. During this first launch, which took place on Thanksgiving Day 1959, the nose fairing began to break away just 45 seconds 
after liftoff, still during first stage operation. Aero
-dynamic forces then caused the third stage and payload to break away and explode. The ground lost contact with the tumbling booster at T+104 
seconds. Investigation showed that the 3-meter fiberglass shroud failed because there had been no measures to account for pressure differentials as the rocket rapidly gained altitude after˜liftoff.171960

but the mission was switched to a direct entry into solar orbit. Pioneer V carried Telebit, the first dig
-ital telemetry system operationally used on a U.S. spacecraftŠit was first tested on Explorer VI. The system used a 5-watt or a 150-watt transmitter, with 
a 5-watt transmitter acting as driver. Information 
rates varied from 1 to 64 bits/second. Controllers maintained contact with Pioneer V until 11:31 UT on 26 June 1960 to a record distance of 36.4 mil-lion kilometers from Earth (later beaten by Mariner II). The probe, using its 18.1-kilogram suite of scientific instruments, confirmed the existence of a previously conjectured weak interplanetary mag-netic field. Information from the magnetometer was unfortunately unusable due to the instrument™s 
position within the spacecraft. Pioneer V remains a derelict spacecraft circling the Sun.15[Luna, Ye-3 no. 1]

Earth and burned up in Earth™s atmosphere, much 
like some of the early American Pioneer probes. The 
most likely reentry point was over central Africa.

engine to successfully ignite and operate in space. Because of the second stage failure, the spacecraft failed to reach sufficient velocity and burned up in Earth™s atmosphere 17 minutes after launch. Later,

-
tially included a TV imaging system (similar to the 
one carried on Luna 3), a UV spectrometer, and 
a spectroreflectometer (to detect organic life on Mars), mass constraints forced engineers to delete 
these instruments a week before launch. A possi
-
bly apocryphal story has it that once removed from the spacecraft, the spectroreflectometer was tested 
not far from the Tyuratam launch site but failed 

to detect any life. The spacecraft itself was a cyl
-inder, about a meter in diameter with all the basic 
systems required of interplanetary travelŠa means 
to regulate temperatures, batteries charged by solar 

panels, a long-distance communication system, 
three-axis stabilization, and a mid-course correc-tion engine (the S5.9). The mission profile called 
for the probe to first enter Earth orbit and then 
use a new fourth stage (called ﬁBlok Lﬂ) capable of 
firing in vacuum, to gain enough additional velocity for a Mars encounter. During the launch, violent 
vibrations caused a gyroscope to malfunction. As a 

result, the booster began to veer from its planned

-cessful predecessors, was to enter lunar orbit. Scientific objectives included studying radiation near the Moon, recording the incidence of micro-meteoroids, and detecting a lunar magnetic field. 
Planned lunar orbital parameters, to be achieved about 60 hours after launch, were 4,300 × 2,400 kilometers with a period of 9Œ10 hours. The space-craft had a slightly different scientific instrument complement than its predecessors, including a 
plasma probe experiment designed by NASA™s 
Ames Research Center that was to provide data on the energy and momentum distribution of streams of protons with energies above a few kilovolts per particle in the vicinity of the Moon. Unfortunately, 
the Atlas Able booster suffered a malfunction 66.68 
seconds after launch and then exploded at T+74 seconds at an altitude of about 12.2 kilometers. Later investigation indicated that the Able upper

send the 1V spacecraft to descend and take pic-tures of the Venusian surface, but this proved to be 
far too ambitious a goal. Engineers instead down-graded the mission and used the 1VA spacecraft for 
a simple Venus atmospheric entry and impact. The 
1VA was essentially a modified 1M spacecraft used 
for Martian exploration (albeit with a different main engine, the S5.14 with a thrust of 200 kgf). The spacecraft contained a small globe containing various souvenirs and medals commemorating the mission. It was also the first Soviet mission to use an intermediate Earth orbit to launch a spacecraft 
into interplanetary space. Although the booster 
successfully placed the probe into Earth orbit, the fourth stage (the Blok L) never fired to send the spacecraft to Venus. A subsequent investigation 
showed that there had been a failure in the PT-200 
DC transformer that ensured power supply to the Blok L guidance system. The part had evidently not been designed for work in vacuum. The space
-craft+upper stage stack reentered on 26 February 
1961. The Soviets announced the total weight of the combination as 6,483 kilograms without spec-ifying any difference between the payload and the upper stage. In the Soviet press, the satellite was usually referred to as Tyazhelyy sputnik

way to Venus, on 12 February, data indicated 
unstable operation of the system designed to keep 

the spacecraft permanently oriented to the Sun, 
needed to generate energy from its solar panels. 
The spacecraft was programmed so that if such a 

problem occurred, it would automatically orient 

itself toward the Sun using gyroscopes, and then 
shut down non-essential systems. Unfortunately, 
it automatically shut down its communications 

system for five days until the next planned com-munications system, because it detected higher 
than usual temperatures in the spacecraft. The 
extra heat was due to the failure of mechanical 

thermal shutters designed to regulate heat in the 

vehicle. Despite these problems, the spacecraft 
responded properly during a communications 
session on 17 February 1961 at a distance of 1.9 

million kilometers when scientific data on inter
-planetary magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and solar 
plasma was returned. Unfortunately, controllers 
were unable to regain contact during a subsequent

investigation indicated that the spacecraft had lost 

its ﬁpermanentﬂ solar orientation due to an optical

eventually passed by Venus on 19Œ20 May 1961 
at a distance of about 100,000 kilometers and 
entered heliocentric orbit. Data from Venera 1

Results: Ranger I was the first in a series of stan
-dardized spacecraft designed to take photos of 

the lunar surface during its descent to the Moon 
and rough-land simple instrumented capsules on 
the surface. The spacecraft consisted of a tubular 

central body connected to a hexagonal base con-taining basic equipment required for control and 
communications. Power was provided by solar 
cells and a silver-zinc battery. Ranger I™s specific 

mission was to test performance of the new tech-
nologies intended for operational Ranger missions 
and also to study the nature of particles and fields 
in interplanetary space. Its intended orbit was 
231961
 60,000 × 1.1. million kilometers. Ranger I was the 
first American spacecraft to use a parking orbit 
around Earth prior to its deep space mission. In 
this case, the Agena B upper stage cut off almost 
immediately after its ignition for trans-lunar injec-tion (instead of firing for 90 seconds). The probe 
remained stranded in low Earth orbit (501 × 168 
kilometers) and telemetry ceased by 27 August 
when the main battery went dead. The spacecraft 
reentered Earth™s atmosphere three days later. 
The cause of the Agena failure was traced to a 
malfunctioning switch which had prematurely 
choked the flow of red fuming nitric acid to the 
rocket˜engine.24Ranger II

Results: Like its predecessor, Ranger II was designed 
to operate in a highly elliptical Earth orbit that would 
take it into deep space beyond the Moon. Mission 
planners expected that during five months of oper-ation, they could verify both the technical design of 
the vehicle and conduct key scientific experiments 
to study the space environment over a prolonged 
period. Since the Block I Rangers (Ranger I and II) 
carried no rocket engine, they could not alter their 
trajectories. On this attempt, Ranger II, like its pre-decessor, failed to leave low Earth orbit, the Agena 
B stage having failed to fire. In its low orbit, Ranger 
II lost its solar orientation and then eventually lost 
power, and reentered on 19 November 1961. The 
most probable cause of the failure was inopera
-tion of the roll control gyroscope on the Agena B 
guidance system. As a result, the stage used up all 
attitude control propellant for its first orbit inser-tion burn. At the time of the second burn, without 
proper attitude, the engine failed to fire.251962

Launch Site: Cape Canaveral / Launch Complex 12
Scientific Instruments:1. vidicon TV camera2. gamma-ray spectrometer3. radar altimeter4. single-axis seismometerResults: This was the first U.S. attempt to impact a probe on the lunar surface. The Block II Ranger 
spacecraft carried a TV camera that used an optical telescope that would allow imaging during descent down to about 24 kilometers above the lunar sur-face. The main bus also carried a 42.6-kilogram 
instrument capsule that would separate at 21.4 kilometers altitude and then independently impact 
on the Moon. Protected by a balsa-wood outer casing, the capsule was designed to bounce several times on the lunar surface before coming to rest. The primary onboard instrument was a seismom-eter. Because of a malfunction in the Atlas guid
-ance system (due to faulty transistors), the probe was inserted into a lunar transfer trajectory with an excessive velocity. A subsequent incorrect course 
change ensured that the spacecraft reached the Moon 14 hours early and missed it by 36,793 kilo-meters on January 28. The central computer and sequencer failed and the spacecraft returned no TV images. The probe did, however, provide sci
-entists with the first measurements of interplane-tary gamma ray flux. Ranger III eventually entered heliocentric orbit.26Ranger IV

spacecraft, it was designed to transmit pictures in the final 10 minutes of its descent to the Moon and rough-land on the lunar surface a balsawood capsule (about 65 centimeters in diameter) that, among other instruments, carried a seismome
-ter. A power failure in the central computer and 
sequencer stopped the spacecraft™s master clock, 
preventing the vehicle from performing any of 
its pre-planned operations, such as opening its solar panels. Drifting aimlessly and without any 26BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016

-nally planned two missions, P-37 and P-38, to be launched on Atlas Centaur rockets, each space
-craft weighing about 565 kilograms. By the time NASA Headquarters formally approved the plan in September 1961, problems with the Atlas Centaur 
necessitated a switch to the Atlas Agena B with a 
reduced payload. By that time, JPL prepared three spacecraft based on the design of the Ranger Block 
I series (therefore named Mariner R) to fly by Venus 
in late 1962. Each spacecraft carried a modest suite (9 kilograms) of scientific instrumentation, but had no imaging capability. The spacecraft 
included 54,000 components and was designed to maintain contact with Earth for 2,500 hoursŠan ambitious goal given that the (still unsuccessful) Ranger was designed for only 65 hours contact. 
Mariner I would have flown by Venus at range of 
29,000 kilometers on 8 December 1962 but due to an incorrect trajectory during launch, at T+294.5 seconds, range safety sent a signal to destroy the Atlas Centaur booster and its payload. The fail-ure was traced to a guidance antenna on the Atlas 
as well as faulty software in its onboard guidance 
program, which was missing a single superscript 
bar. The press described it as ﬁthe most expensive

 Results: This was the first of a second generation 
of Soviet deep space probes based on a unified 
platform called 2MV (ﬁ2ﬂ for the second genera
-tion, ﬁMVﬂ for Mars and Venera) designed to study 
Mars and Venus. The series included four vari
-ants with the same bus but with different payload 
complements: 2MV-1 (for Venus impact), 2MV-2 
(for Venus flyby), 2MV-3 (for Mars impact), and 
2MV-4 (for Mars flyby). The buses were basically 
similar in design carrying all the essential systems 
to support the mission as well as a main engine, 
the S5.17 on the two Venus probes, and the S5.19 
on the Mars probes. Both had a thrust of 200 kgf 
but the former was capable of one firing while the 
latter was designed for two. The payloads were 
designed in two variants depending on whether the 
mission was a flyby mission or an impact mission. 
In the former, there was an instrument module, 
and in the latter, it carried a 90-centimeter diam
-eter spherical pressurized lander covered by ther
-mal coating; the Venus landers were cooled with 
an ammonia-based system, while the Mars land-ers used a system of air conditioners. Both landers 
were sterilized with a special substance on recom-mendation from the Academy of Sciences™ Insti
-tute of Microbiology. The buses were powered by 
solar panels with an area of 2.5 m2 capable of pro-viding 2.6 A. The Venus impact probes were to use 
a three-stage parachute system to descend through 
the atmosphere. For Venus, the Soviets prepared 
three spacecraft for the AugustŒSeptember 1962 
launch period, one flyby spacecraft and two land-ers. This first spacecraftŠa flyby plus lander 
combinationŠwas successfully launched into 
Earth orbit, but the Blok L upper stage cut off its 
interplanetary burn after only 45 seconds (instead 
of the planned 240 seconds). Later investigation 
showed that the stage had been set on a tumbling 
motion prior to main engine ignition due to asym-metrical firing of the solid propellant stabilizing 
motors. The spacecraft remained in Earth orbit for 
three days before reentering Earth™s˜atmosphere.

Mariner II was equipped with an identical complement of instrumentation as its predecessor (see Mariner I). The mission proved to be the first fully successful interplanetary mission performed by any nation. After a mid-course correc
-tion on 4 September, the spacecraft flew by Venus 
at a range of 34,854 kilometers at 19:59:28 UT on 
14 December 1962. During a 42-minute scan of the planet, Mariner II gathered significant data on the Venusian atmosphere and surface before con
-tinuing on to heliocentric orbit. The radiometers, in particular, were able to conduct five scans of the 
nightside of the planet, eight across the terminator, 
and five on the daylight side. NASA maintained contact until 07:00 UT on 3 January 1963 when the spacecraft was 86.68 million kilometers from Earth, a new distance record for a deep space probe. The data returned implied that there was no significant difference in temperature across Venus: 
readings from Mariner II™s microwave radiometer 
indicated temperatures of 216°C (on the dark side) to 237°C (on the day side). Mariner II also found 
that there was a dense cloud layer that extended 
from 56 to 80 kilometers above the surface. The spacecraft detected no discernable planetary mag-netic field, partly explained by the great distance between the spacecraft and the planet. If in terms of scientific results, Mariner II was only a modest success, it still retains the honor of being the very first successful planetary science mission in his-tory. NASA elected to stand down the third space
-craft in the series (Mariner R-3) scheduled for the 1964 launch period.This 1961 photo shows Dr. William H. Pickering, (center) JPL Director, presenting a Mariner spacecraft model to President

the repeated failures of the Blok L upper

of the scientific instruments were deleted from the Mars spacecraft. The three mis-sions were primarily technological test 311962
 flights rather than scientific missions. In this case, the Blok L interplanetary stage failed again. Just 
17 seconds after trans-Mars injection ignition, the turbopump of the main engine (the S1.5400A1) exploded, destroying the payload. The problem was 
traced to leaking lubricant. As many as 24 frag

Results: The second of three Soviet spacecraft 
intended for the 1962 Mars launch period, Mars 
1 was the first spacecraft sent by any nation to fly 
past Mars. Its primary mission was to photograph 
the surface during a flyby from a range of between 
1,000 to 11,000 kilometers. In comparison to its 
predecessor, the probe had a slightly different main 
engine (the S5.19) than the Venus probes, with a 
reduced propellant tank mass. The camera system, 
weighing 32 kilograms, included both 35 and 750 
mm lenses and used 70 mm film. It could take up to 
112 frames, stored on film and then to be scanned 
for playback to Earth. After successful insertion 
into Earth orbit, the Blok L upper stage success-fully fired the probe towards Mars, but immedi-ately after engine cutoff, controllers discovered that 
pressure in one of the nitrogen gas bottles for the 
spacecraft™s attitude control system dropped to zero 
(due to incomplete closure of a valve). Before all the 
compressed nitrogen was lost, on 6Œ7 November, 
controllers were able to spin the vehicle around the 
axis perpendicular to the plane of the solar panels 
to enable a backup gyroscope system to keep the 
solar panels constantly exposed to the Sun during 
the coast phase. Further mid-course corrections, 
however, proved impossible. Controllers main
-tained contact with the vehicle until 21 March 
1963 when the probe was 106 million kilome
-ters from Earth. According to TASS (on 16 May), 
because of the failure of orientation, ﬁthe direction 
of the station™s antennas toward Earth was upset.ﬂ 
This anomaly prevented further radio contact after 
21 March. Mars 1 silently flew by Mars at a dis-tance of 197,000 kilometers on 19 June 1963. Prior 
to loss of contact, scientists were able to collect 
data on interplanetary space (on cosmic ray inten
-sity, Earth™s magnetic fields, ionized gases from the 
Sun, and meteoroid impact densities) up to a dis-tance of 1.24 AUs. The data from Mars 1 (from 20 
November 1962 to 25 January 1963) showed that 
once past 0.24 AUs, i.e., Earth™s radiation belts, the 
intensity of cosmic radiation was virtually constant.35[Mars, 2MV-3 no. 1]

During the trans-Mars injection firing of the Blok L upper stage, the main engine (the S1.5400A1) prema-turely shut down after 33 seconds due to a mal-function in the programmed timer for the stage. 
The problem was later traced to excessive vibra-tions of the second stage during liftoff. These vibrations also jarred loose a pyrotechnic igniter 
from its support, preventing the Blok L from firing. The spacecraft remained stranded in Earth orbit and reentered the atmosphere on 5 November.

simple 100-kilogram lander capsules (called the Automatic Lunar Station or Avtomaticheskaya lun

to send back photographs from the lunar surface. Each egg-shaped ALS was installed on a roughly

about three days before landing on the Moon on 
7 January at 19:55:10 UT. Like many of its deep 
space predecessors, the probe failed to escape Earth orbit because of a failure in the Blok L trans-lunar injection stage. There was apparently a failure in a current converter in the power system of the I-100 instrument container (which controlled both the 
Blok L and the spacecraft), which as a result, failed to issue a command to fire the Blok L engine. The spacecraft remained in Earth orbit, unacknowl-edged by the Soviets until 11 January 1963.37[Luna, Ye-6 no. 3]

Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system2. gas-discharge counterResults: The third Soviet attempt to perform a lunar soft-landing (planned for 19:42:37 UT on 5 April) 
was the first in which the spacecraft actually left Earth orbit. During the coast to the Moon, the 
spacecraft™s Yupiter-M astronavigation system suf
-fered a major failure (probably related to its thermal control system) and left the probe in an incorrect attitude. As a result, Luna 4 was unable to perform 
its planned mid-course correction. Although com
-munications were maintained with the spacecraft, it passed by the Moon at a range of 8,500 kilome-ters at 01:24 UT on 6 April and eventually entered 
heliocentric orbit from its intermediate barycentric orbit. Data from the gas-discharge counter was compared with data from Mars 1 to provide fur
-ther clarification to a radiation map of Earth up to 
lunar distance. The data showed that the intensity of cosmic radiation remained ﬁvirtually constantﬂ up to 0.24 AU from the Earth.

ﬁthird generationﬂ deep space planetary probes of the 3MV series. Like the second generation, Soviet engineers planned four types of the 3MV, 
the 3MV-1 (for Venus impact), 3MV-2 (for Venus 
flyby), 3MV-3 (for Mars impact), and 3MV-4 
(for Mars flyby). The primary difference over the 
second generation was vastly improved (and in many cases doubled) orientation system elements as well as improved on board propulsion systems. While these four versions were meant to study Mars and Venus, the Soviets conceived of two 
additional variants of the series, similar but not 
identical to the 3MV-1 and 3MV-4 versions, with 
the designations 3MV-1A and 3MV-4A. These 
351963
 ﬁObject-Probesﬂ (ob™yekt-zond) were designed to verify key technological systems during simpler missions into deep space and back to Earth. A gov
-ernment decree on March 21, 1963 had approved two to three such ﬁobject-probeﬂ missions, one of which (a 3MV-1A) was designed to depart from 
Earth™s ecliptic (the orbital plane of Earth around 
the Sun) out to 12Œ16 million kilometers from Earth and then return back to Earth after about six months when its orbit intersected with that of Earth again, aided by two mid-course corrections using its S5.45 main engine. The latter, capable of 
two firings, was a lighter version of that used on the 2MV model with higher specific impulse and a longer burn time. During this mission, the third and fourth stages separated abnormally, and after 
reaching Earth orbit, ground control lost teleme-try (at about 06:45:44 UT) from the Blok L upper stage designed to send the vehicle past the Moon. As a result, the spacecraft remained stranded in 
Earth orbit. The stage™s main engine turbopump 
probably exploded upon ignition destroying the spacecraft. With this mission, the Soviets began 
the practice of giving ﬁKosmosﬂ designations to obscure the failure of lunar and planetary probes that remained stranded in Earth orbit. If the space-craft had successfully departed from Earth orbit, it 
would probably have been called ﬁZond 1.ﬂ371964

Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system (six TV cameras)Results: This fourth American attempt to lunar 
impact was the closest success so far. The space
-craft, the first Block III type vehicle with a suite of 
six TV cameras, was sterilized to avoid contaminat
-ing the lunar surface. The series would also serve 
as a testbed for future interplanetary spacecraft by 
deploying systems (such as solar panels) that could 
be used for more ambitious missions. The Block III 
spacecraft carried a 173-kilogram TV unit (replacing 
the impact capsule carried on the Block II Ranger 
spacecraft). The six cameras included two full-scan 
and four partial-scan cameras, capable of shooting 
300 pictures a minute. Ranger VI flew to the Moon 
successfully and impacted precisely on sched-ule at 09:24:32 UT on 2 February. Unfortunately, 
the power supply for the TV camera package had 
short-circuited during Atlas booster separation three 
days previously and left the system inoperable. The 
cameras were to have transmitted high-resolution 
photos of the lunar approach from 1,448 kilometers 
to 6.4 kilometers range in support of Project Apollo.

(see Kosmos 21), it appears not to have carried a lander. Its mission was to test its propulsion, ther
-mal, and communications systems during a four-
month flight in the direction of Venus to a distance 
of about 40 million kilometers. In the event, the spacecraft failed to reach Earth orbit due to a mal
-function in the launch vehicle™s third stage. Later 
investigation indicated that a liquid oxygen leak through an unpressurized valve (the B4311-O) 38BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
seal froze propellant in the main pipeline while the rocket was still on the launch pad. As a result,

Results: The probe was the first dedicated 3MV spacecraft that the Soviets launched (earlier mis-sions had been of the test ﬁObject-Probeﬂ ver-sions). It was designed to accomplish atmospheric entry into Venus followed by descent and impact. 
The spacecraft successfully reached Earth orbit 
but failed to leave for Venus when the Blok L 
upper stage malfunctioned. The upper stage lost 
stable attitude due to a failure in the circuit of the power supply circuit that powered the valves for the attitude control system; hence, the stage remained uncontrollable and not ready to initi-ate a burn to leave Earth orbit. The problem was traced to a design error rather than one related to quality control. The spacecraft burned up in Earth™s atmosphere the following day. If success
-ful, this mission would probably have been given a ﬁVeneraﬂ˜designation.

Results: This was the second dedicated launch of the 3MV series (not including two ﬁObject-Probesﬂ). Like its predecessor (see Kosmos 27), it was also designed for atmospheric entry and then impact on Venus. Although the probe was success
-fully sent towards Venus, ground controllers faced 
a series of major malfunctions in the spacecraft during its coast to the planet. These malfunctions included depressurization of the main spacecraft bus when the glass cover of a Sun-star attitude control sensor cracked. Additionally, the internal 
radio transmitters of the spacecraft were automat-ically switched on at precisely the wrong time, i.e., during depressurization, when the gas discharge created high-voltage currents that shorted out the communications system. As a result, communica
-tions had to be conducted through transmitters on the 290-kilogram pressurized descent module. Last contact was on 25 May 1964, by which time, controllers managed to conduct two major course corrections (at 560,000 and 13Œ14 mil-lion kilometers from Earth respectively), the first time such actions had been performed on a Soviet interplanetary spacecraft. The second correction, however, imparted 20 meters/second less velocity 
than required, ensuring that the vehicle would not intersect with Venus. The inert spacecraft eventu
-ally flew by Venus on 19 July 1964 at a range of 
110,000 kilometers. The Soviets named the vehicle 
ﬁZondﬂ (the Russian word for ﬁprobeﬂ) even though 
it was not one of the Object-Probe testbed space-craft; this was done to disguise the fact that it was 
a failed Venus mission. If it had actually succeeded 
in its Venus mission, it probably would have been 
named ﬁVenera 2.ﬂ (Undoubtedly this has confused 
historians since this was not an Object-Probe mis-sion). The Soviets later published some data on cosmic ray flux measured by Zond 1.45[Luna, Ye-6 no. 5]

Results: This was the fifth Soviet attempt at a lunar soft-landing. The mission was aborted early, during 
the ascent to Earth orbit, when the launch vehicle™s 
third stage engine (Blok I) prematurely shut down after 50 seconds of firing (at T+340 seconds). U.S. 
Air Force radars in Turkey apparently monitored 

the failed launch. A subsequent investigation indi
-cated that the engine cut off due to loss of power 
when a circuit between a battery in the fourth stage 
(which powered the third stage engine) and the

the first unequivocal success in U.S. efforts to explore the Moon. In some ways, it marked a major milestone in American deep space exploration as 
the ratio in favor of successes increased dramati
-cally after this point. After a nominal mid-course 
correction on 29 July, Ranger VII approached the 
Moon precisely on target two days later. Just fif
-teen minutes prior to impact, the suite of TV cam-eras began sending back spectacular photos of the approaching surface to JPL™s Goldstone antenna in 
California. The last of 4,316 images was transmit
-ted only 2.3 seconds prior to impact at 13:25:49 UT on 31 July 1964. The impact point was at 10° 38˜ S / 20° 36˜ W on the northern rim of the Sea of Clouds. Scientists on the ground were more than satisfied with results; image resolution was, in many cases, one thousand times better than photos taken from Earth. Scientists concluded that an Apollo crewed landing would be possible in the 
mare regions of the lunar surface, given their rela

Mars 1964 project in November 1962. The primary goal of the two spacecraft, code-named Mariner 
C, was to photograph the Martian surface using 
a single TV camera fixed on a scan platform that 
could return up to 22 frames after an eight-month 
journey. During the launch of Mariner III, the 
first of the two probes, the booster payload shroud 
failed to separate from the payload. Additionally, 
battery power spuriously dropped to zero (at T+8 
hours 43 minutes) and the spacecraft™s solar panels 
apparently never unfurled to replenish the power 
supply. Due to the incorrect mass of the spacecraft 
(since the payload shroud was still attached), it 
never entered a proper trans-Mars trajectory. The 
probe ended up in an unanticipated heliocentric 
orbit of 0.983 × 1.311 AU. A later investigation 
indicated that the shroud™s inner fiberglass layer 
had separated from the shroud™s outer skin, thus 
preventing jettisoning.48Mariner IV

the Space Age, returning the very first photos of 
another planet from deep space. Using a new all-metal shroud, the spacecraft lifted off without any problems and was successfully boosted towards 
Mars by the Agena D upper stage. A single mid-

 kilometers from the Martian surface. On one of the scientific instruments, the plasma probe, there was a component failure making its readings unintelli-gible although due to a better telemetry rate, some data was received between January and May 1965. Additionally, a Geiger tube, one of the two sensors 
in the ionization chamber experiment, failed and stopped returning data in March 1965. Approxi
-mately 40 minutes prior to closest approach (which was at 01:00:57 UT on 15 July 1965 at a range of 9,846 kilometers), the TV camera began taking the 
first of 21 images (plus 22 lines of a 22nd) through red and green filters. About 1.25 hours after the 
encounter, Mariner IV dipped behind the right-
hand side of Mars (as viewed from Earth) in an occultation experiment in order to refract its radio signals through the Martian atmosphere. Data indicated that surface pressure was quite low, i.e., 
future Mars landers would have to be equipped 
with retro-rocket engines in addition to parachutes. The images as well as the occultation experiment fundamentally transformed the scientific view of the Red Planet, providing hard data where specula-tion had previously dominated. The probe detected daytime surface temperatures at about Œ100°C. A very weak radiation belt, about 0.1% of that of Earth™s, was also detected. The day after the clos
-est encounter, Mariner IV began transmitting its 
photos back to Earth. The images clearly showed Mars to be an ancient Moon-like body with wide-spread cratering, thus incontrovertibly quashing any expectations of lost civilizations on the planet. Given the thin atmosphere, scientists believed that it was unlikely that Mars harbored any life. NASA maintained contact with the spacecraft until 1 October 1965 when the probe was 309 million kilometers from Earth. Two years later, in October 
1967, the spacecraft was reactivated for attitude control tests in support of the Mariner V mission to Venus that used a similar spacecraft bus. Con
-tact was maintained until 31 December 1967, over three years after launch.49Zond 2Nation: USSR (29)

space missions. Originally intended to fly in the April-May 1964 time period, this launch was con-stantly delayed and then ultimately timed for the 
late 1964 Mars opportunity. Besides carrying out 
long-distance communications tests and imaging Earth on the way out into deep space, this vehi-cle™s trajectory was designed to allow it to inter
-cept Mars (on approximately 6 August 1965) and 
become the first probe to enter its atmosphere and 
impact on its surface. After successfully enter
-ing a trans-Mars trajectory, ground controllers 
44BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
discovered that the probe™s solar panels had not 
completely unfurled, depriving the vehicle of full 
power. Later investigation indicated that a tug cord 
designed to pull the panels free at the moment of separation from the Block L upper stage had 
broken off. Controllers were able to fully open the 
panel only on 15 December 1964, after ﬁcarrying out a number of dynamic operations on the sta-tionﬂ according to the official institutional history, 
but by then the time for the first mid-course cor-rection to fly by Mars had already passed. (Other 
reports suggest that even after the panels opened, they were partially obscured by radiators installed 
at the end of the solar panels which had not prop-erly deployed). Additionally, there had been a fail
-ure in the onboard programmed timer immediately 
after trans-interplanetary injection that led to inap-propriate thermal conditions for the spacecraft between communications sessions. Before loss of contact, on 14 December, Zond 2 successfully 
fired six plasma electric rocket engines (twice) at a distance of 5.37 million kilometers from Earth. They were left ﬁonﬂ for 70 minutes and successfully maintained orientation of the spacecraft. These were technology demonstrators for future deep space missions. (These were actually carried on an earlier 3MV-1A model, launched on 11 November 
1963, but that spacecraft failed to leave Earth orbit 
and was named Kosmos 21.) While some Western 
sources suggest that contact was maintained with Zond 2 until 4Œ5 May 1965, this is highly unlikely. 
The silent probe passed by Mars at a range of 650,000 kilometers on 6 August 1965 and entered 
heliocentric orbit. The spacecraft returned usable data on cosmic radio emissions at 210 and 2200 kc/second, up to 8 Earth radii distance from Earth.451965

On this mission, engineers redesigned the prob-lematic I-100 control system that had caused most of the previous failures. Previously the I-100 unit had controlled both the Blok L upper stage and the spacecraft itself. On this mission (and subsequent Lunas), the fourth stage and the Ye-6 spacecraft had 
separate systems. Unfortunately, this probe never 
reached Earth orbit. During the launch, depressur-ization of a nitrogen pipe for the liquid oxygen tank on the third stage (Blok I) prevented third stage engine ignition. The spacecraft thus broke up over the Pacific without reaching Earth orbit.

head for the Moon in two years. Following a mid-
course correction on 10 May, the spacecraft began 
spinning around its main axis due to a problem in a floatation gyroscope in the I-100 control system unitŠthe gyroscopes apparently had had too little 
time to warm up before being used for attitude con-trol. A subsequent attempt to fire the main engine 
failed due to ground control error. A third attempt

Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system2. SBM-10 radiation detectorResults: On this ninth Soviet attempt at a lunar soft-landing, the mission proceeded as planned 
until a major mid-course correction late on 9 June. Although the main retro-rocket engine (the S5.5A) ignited on time, it failed to cut off and continued 
to fire until propellant supply was exhausted. An 

investigation later indicated that the problem had been due to human error; a command had been 
mistakenly sent to the timer that ordered the main 
engine to shut down. Although the spacecraft was 

sent on a completely off-nominal trajectory, ground 
controllers put the spacecraft through a series of steps to practice an actual landing (such as inflat-ing the airbags, separating the lander, etc.), all of 

which were satisfactorily accomplished. Luna 6 passed by the Moon late on 11 June at a range of 161,000 kilometers and eventually entered helio-centric orbit. Contact was maintained to a distance 
of 600,000 kilometers from Earth.The Zond 3 spacecraft (of the 3MV-4 type) returned higher

Instead, Soviet designers diverted the mission for a simple lunar flyby in 1965 to test its basic systems and pho-tograph the farside of the Moon. After a successful 
trans-lunar injection burn, Zond 3 approached the Moon after only a 33-hour flight. Its imaging mis-sion began at 01:24 hours on 20 July at a range of 11,600 kilometers from the near side of the Moon and completed 68 minutes later. Zond 3 carried an 
imaging system somewhat similar to the one car-ried on Automatic Interplanetary Station (ﬁLuna 
3ﬂ), with onboard exposure, development, fixing, and drying prior to scanning for transmission to Earth. The new system, known as 15P52, weighed 6.5 kilograms, was developed by the Moscow-based NII-885 (as opposed to VNII-380, which devel-oped the Luna-3 system). In total, the spacecraft 
took 25 visual and three ultraviolet images during its flyby. Closest approach was to 9,220 kilome
-ters. These pictures were successfully transmitted back to Earth on July 29, nine days after its lunar encounter when it was 2.2 million kilometers from Earth. Further communications sessions occurred on 23 October (involving photo transmissions) when Zond 3 was 31.5 million kilometers from Earth. Last contact was sometime in early March 1966 when the spacecraft was 153.5 million kilo-meters away. During the mission, it photographed 
the unseen 30% of the farside of the Moon. Zond˜3 
also demonstrated successful course corrections 
using both solar and stellar orientation, a first for a Soviet spacecraft.58Surveyor Model 1

Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system2. SBM-10 radiation detectorResults: The first attempt to launch this vehicle 
took place at 07:05:36 UT on 4 September 1965 but the launch was aborted due to a problem in a sensor that measured relative velocity on the rocket. The subsequent launch a month later went off successfully and the Blok L upper stage 
successfully sent Luna 7 on its way to the Moon. Unlike its predecessors, Luna 7 successfully car-ried out its mid-course correction on October 5 on the way to the Moon, in anticipation of a soft-land-ing two days later (at the time planned for 2208 UT on 7 October). Unfortunately, immediately 
prior to planned retro-fire during the approach 
to the lunar surface, the spacecraft suddenly lost attitude control and failed to regain it. One of its attitude control sensorsŠthe one designed to lock on to EarthŠstopped functioning, preventing it from reaching the desired orientation for firing 
its retro-engine. Automatic programmed systems 
then prevented the main engine from firing. As 
controllers observed helplessly, Luna 7 plummeted 
to the lunar surface at a very high speed, crashing at 22:08:24 UT on 7˜October west of the Kepler 
crater, relatively near to the actual intended target. 
Impact coordinates were 9° N / 49° W. Later inves
-tigation indicated that the optical sensor of the 
Yupiter-M astronavigation system had been set at 
the wrong angle and had lost sight of Earth during the critical attitude control maneuver. It was the 
tenth consecutive failure in the Ye-6 program.

-craft were originally intended for Mars exploration, 
the Soviets re-equipped three of the series, left over 
from the 1964 Mars launch periods, for Venus explo
-ration in 1965. This particular vehicle was sched-uled to fly past the sunlit side of Venus at no more 
than 40,000 kilometers range and take photographs. 
About 3 hours after injection into heliocentric orbit, 
contact was temporarily lost with the spacecraft, and 
although it was regained soon after, the event was 
symptomatic of the mission in general during which 
communications were generally poor. Before clos
-est approach in late February 1966, ground control 
switched on all the onboard scientific instrumenta
-tion. Closest approach to the planet was at 02:52˜UT 
on 27 February 1966 at about 24,000 kilometers 
range. After its flyby, when the spacecraft was sup
-posed to relay back the collected information, ground 
control was unable to regain contact. Controllers 
finally gave up all attempts at communication on 
4 March. Venera 2 eventually entered heliocentric 
orbit. Later investigation indicated that improper 
functioning of 40 thermal radiator elements caused a 
sharp increase in gas temperatures in the spacecraft. 
As a result, elements of the receiving and decoding 
units failed (and the solar panels overheated), and 
contact was lost. Ironically, the scientific instruments 
may have collected valuable data, but none of it was 
ever transmitted back to Earth.511965

in late 1965. Venera 3 successfully left Earth orbit 
carrying a small 0.9-meter diameter 310-kilogram 
landing capsule to explore the Venusian atmo
-sphere and transmit data on pressure, temperature, 
and composition of the Venusian atmosphere back 
to Earth during the descent by parachute. During 
the outbound trajectory, ground controllers suc
-cessfully performed a mid-course correction on 
26 December 1965 and completed 63 commu-nications sessions during which scientists on the 
ground recorded valuable information. For example, 
between 16 November 1965 and 7 January 1966, a 
modulation charged particle trap (of the same type 
carried on Zond 2), provided valuable data on the 
energy spectra of solar wind ion streams beyond the 
Earth™s magnetosphere. Contact was, however, lost 
on 16 February 1966, shortly before the Venusian 
encounter. The spacecraft subsequently automat
-ically released its lander probe which impacted 
inertly onto the Venusian surface at 06:56:26 UT 
on 1 March 1966, only 4 minutes earlier than 
planned. It was the first time a human-made object 
made physical contact with another planetary body 
other than the Moon. The impact location was on 
the night side of Venus, near the terminator, in the 
range of Œ20° to 20° N / 60° to 80° E. In response to 
concern from some American and British scientists, 
the Soviet press emphasized that ﬁprior to liftoff, 
the descent module was subject to careful steril-ization, required to dispose of all microorganisms 
of terrestrial origin and thus prevent the possibility 
of contamination.ﬂ Later investigation confirmed 
that Venera 3 suffered many of the same failures as 
Venera 2, i.e., overheating of internal components 
and the solar panels.62Kosmos 96 [Venera]

correction at 19:00 UT on 4 December, the space

Moon without any apparent problems. Just prior to the planned retro-fire burn, a command was sent to inflate cushioning airbags around the ALS lander 

probe. Unfortunately, a plastic mounting bracket 

appears to have pierced one of the two bags. The resulting expulsion of air put the spacecraft into a spin (of 12°/second). The vehicle momentar-ily regained attitude, long enough for a 9-second 
retro-engine firing, but then lost it again. Without 
a full retro-burn to reduce approach velocity suffi-cient for a survivable landing, Luna 8 plummeted to the lunar surface and crashed at 21:51:30 UT on 
6 December just west of the Kepler crater. Impact 
coordinates were 9° 8˜ N / 63° 18˜ W. The Soviet

Results: Pioneer VI was the first of several NASA 
spacecraft designed for launch at six-month inter-vals to study interplanetary phenomena in space in 
heliocentric orbits similar to that of Earth. These 
spacecraft successfully provided simultaneous 

scientific measurements at widely dispersed loca-tions in heliocentric orbit. The so-called Improved 
Thrust Augmented Delta launch vehicle™s third 
stage burned for 23 seconds to boost Pioneer VI 

into heliocentric orbit. Initial solar orbit for the 

spacecraft ranged from 0.814 AU (perihelion) to 
0.985 AU (aphelion) with a period of 311.3 days. 
By 2 March 1966, Pioneer VI had transmitted 

about 250 million readings from its six scientific 

instruments. In the fall of 1969, JPL and UCLA 
scientists reported the results of a solar occultation 
performed from 21Œ24 November 1968. This was 

the first time that a spacecraft had been tracked 

while passing behind the Sun, allowing scien-tists, despite an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio 

of data transmission, to examine the solar corona 

during this passage. Scientists used instruments 
54BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
on Pioneer˜VI in coordination with those on 
Pioneer˜VII, in November and December 1969, 
to measure solar wind particles and carry out 
long-distance communications experiments. Five years after launch, at the end of 1970, Pioneer VI had orbited the Sun six times, and had passed by the Sun™s far side (relative to Earth), sending back 
new information on the solar atmosphere and reg-ular solar weather reports. One of the two radio receivers was still operational, and although some of the solar cells had been damaged by solar flares, the spacecraft was still getting sufficient power to operate satisfactorily. Pioneer VI returned the first 
data on the tenuous solar atmosphere and later recorded the passage of Comet Kohoutek™s tail 
in 1974 (in conjunction with Pioneer VIII) from a range of about 100 million kilometers from the comet™s nucleus. Along with Pioneers VII, VIII, and 
IX, the spacecraft formed a ring of solar weather stations spaced along Earth™s orbit. Measurements 
by the four Pioneers were used to predict solar storms for approximately 1,000 primary users including the Federal Aviation Agency, commercial 
airlines, power companies, communication compa-nies, military organizations, and entities involved 
in surveying, navigation, and electronic prospect-ing. By December 1990, Pioneer VI had circled the Sun 29 times (travelling 24.8 billion kilome-ters) and had been operational for twenty straight yearsŠa record for a deep space probe. Its original 
slated lifetime had been only six months, achieved on 16˜June 1966. Of the spacecraft™s six scientific 
instruments, two (the plasma Faraday cup and 
the cosmic ray detector) functioned well into the 1990s. NASA maintained contact with the space
-craft once or twice each year during the 1990s. For example, one hour™s worth of scientific data 
was collected on 29 July and 15 December 1995, although the primary transmitter failed the follow
-ing year. Soon after, on 31 March 1997, NASA 
officially declared the mission complete largely due to the costs associated with continuing com-munications sessions. Despite the decision, con
-tact was established with the backup transmitter on 6 October 1997 as part of a training exercise for 
the Lunar Prospector spacecraft. By this point, the probe™s solar arrays had deteriorated although the 
transmitter could still be turned on at perihelion when the solar flux was strong enough to provide sufficient power. On 8 December 2000, ground 
controllers established successful contact for 2 
hours to commemorate the 35th year of operation. This, however, proved to be the very last contact 
made with the probe.551966

Results: With this mission, the Soviets accomplished 
another spectacular first in the space race, the first 
survivable landing of a human-made object on 
another celestial body and the transmission of pho-tographs from its surface. Luna 9 was the twelfth

spacecraft. All operations prior to landing occurred 
without fault. A 48-second mid-course correction 
at 19:29 UT on 1 February some 233,000 kilome
-ters from the Moon directed the probe directly to its 
target in the Ocean of Storms. About one hour before 
touchdown at a distance of 8,300 kilometers, Luna 9 
was put in proper attitude for retro-fire. Just prior to 
engine ignition, two side compartments were jetti-soned, followed by inflation of two shock-absorbing 
airbags covering the lander to a pressure of 1 atmo
-sphere. Its main S5.5A engine ignited at an altitude 
of 74.885 kilometers above the surface and fired for 
48 seconds until the probe was just 260Œ265 meters 
above ground, thus decelerating Luna 9 from 2,600 
meters/second to a few meters/second. Just above 
the surface, a long boom sensor made contact with 
the lunar surface, thus issuing a command to eject 
the 58-centimeter spheroid ALS capsule weighing 
99.8 kilograms from the main bus. The ALS (still 
enclosed in surrounded airbags) landed a few meters 
away. The impact time was recorded as 18:45:30 UT 
on 3 February 1966 west of the Reiner and Marius 
craters in the Ocean of Storms (reported as 7° 8˜ N / 
 64° 32
˜ W but closer to 8° N / 64° W). About four 
minutes after landing, the airbags split open, and the 
petals covering the top of the ALS were deployed. 
Precisely four minutes and 10 seconds after touch-down, Luna 9 began transmitting initial telemetry 
data back to Earth, although it would be another 
7 hours (at 01:50 UT on 4 February, after the Sun 
climbed from 3° to 7° elevation) before the probe 
began sending back the first of nine images (including 
five panoramas) of the surface of the Moon. The first 
panoramic images arrived very early in the morning 
in Moscow, and because officials were afraid to wake 
up Soviet space program curator Dmitriy Ustinov 
(1908Œ1984) (whose permission was required for 
publication in the Soviet media), the first panoramic 
images were actually published in the British media 
courtesy of Sir Bernard Lovell (1913Œ2012) at the 
Jodrell Bank Observatory who had intercepted and 
analyzed the same data. The later images had the 
Sun much high up, up to 41°, thus causing the 
shadow relief of the images to change. These were 
the first images sent back from the surface of another 
planetary body. Controllers noticed at one point that 
Luna 9™s vantage point had slightly shifted over the 
sequence of images, possibly caused by the dimin-ishing water supply of its thermal control system 
which changed its weight distribution. This change 
in perspective (of about 100 mm) opened up the 
possibility of stereo photography of the surface. The 
KS-17M radiation detector measured a dosage of 30 
millirads per day. Perhaps the most important discov
-ery from the mission was determining that a foreign 
object would not simply sink into the lunar dust, i.e., 
that the ground could support a heavy lander. Mis
-sion controllers expected that the last communica-tions session would be on 5˜February (from 16:00 
to 17:41 UT) but were pleased to have an additional 
one, on 6 February (from 20:37 to 22:55 UT). By the 
time contact was lost, controllers had communicated 
with Luna 9 over seven communications sessions 
lasting 8 hours and 5 minutes.66Kosmos 111 [Luna]

 Results: In early 1966, the Soviets hastily put together an interim lunar orbiter program, the Ye-6S, partly 
to upstage the American Lunar Orbiter project, and 
partly to commemorate the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party held in March 1966. Engineers 
quickly designed a set of two rudimentary probes using the old Ye-6 (lander) buses for these mis
-sions. The first of these was prepared in less than a month but failed to leave Earth orbit. During Earth 
orbit operations, the Blok L upper stage lost roll control and failed to fire to send the probe towards the Moon. The official Soviet media named the stranded satellite Kosmos 111 which reentered two days after launch.67Luna 10

Luna 10, the second and backup model of two hastily prepared Soviet Ye-6S probes, success
-fully entered lunar orbit two days later at 18:44 UT, thus becoming the first human-made object 
to go into orbit around another planetary body. A 
248.5-kilogram instrument compartment sepa-rated from the main bus at 18:45:39 UT which was in a 350 × 1,016-kilometer orbit inclined at 71.9° to the lunar equator. The spacecraft carried a set of 
solid-state oscillators which had been programmed to reproduce the notes of the Internationale so that it could be broadcast live to the 23rd Communist Party Congress. During a rehearsal on the night of 
3 April, the playback went well, but the following 
morning, controllers discovered a missing note and 
so played the previous night™s tape to the assem
-bled gathering at the Congress, claiming it was a live broadcast from the Moon. Luna 10 conducted 
extensive research in lunar orbit, gathering import-ant data on the weakness of the Moon™s magnetic 
field, radiation belts, and micrometeoroid density. 
In 2012, a Soviet scientist made the claim that Luna 
10™s achievements included ﬁthe first gamma-ray 
spectrometer used in the history of space research to first define the contents of natural radio nuclides in the lunar soil.ﬂ Data from Luna˜10 suggested 
that Moon rocks were comparable to terrestrial basalt rocks. Based on data collected by the probe, 
Efraim Akim (1929Œ2010) at the USSR Academy 
of Sciences identified the ﬁnoncentrality of the 
gravitational field of the Moonﬂ which he argued was ﬁthe essential fact determining the evolution of the orbit of Luna 10,ﬂ as reported in an Academy 
journal in 1966. Based on Akim™s claim, some 
sources incorrectly credit Luna 10 with discovery of mass concentrations (called ﬁmasconsﬂ)Šareas 
of high density below the mare basins that distort lunar orbital trajectories. Their discovery, however, 
came much later, after the creation of a gravimetric 
map of the Moon (albeit at the time, only of the near side of the Moon). Paul Muller and William 
Sjogren published their conclusions in 1968 based on data from the Lunar Orbiters showing that very large positive gravity anomalies exist in all of the circular ringed sea basins on the Moon. The dis
-covery of mascons thus should be credited to them. Controllers made last contact with Luna˜10 on

Results: This was a test to launch a dummy Surveyor lunar lander spacecraft into a barycentric orbit 
towards a simulated Moon. Unlike the two pre-vious Surveyor mass model tests, this flight was 
supposed to demonstrate a restart capability for the Centaur upper stage. The Centaur-Surveyor 
combination successfully achieved parking orbit 
around Earth (with a first firing), but at the desired time, when it came time for the second firing, the Centaur RL-10 engines fired for only a few sec-onds (instead of 107 seconds). A thrust imbalance 
left the payload tumbling and in an incorrect orbit 
of 182 × 335 kilometers at 30.7° inclination. The 
problem was later traced to a hydrogen peroxide 
leak in the ullage motors of the Centaur stage. With 
no hope of reaching its ultimate orbit (planned for 167 × 380,000 km), the payload reentered on 5˜May 1966.69Surveyor I

Scientific Instruments:1. TV cameraResults: In January 1961, NASA selected Hughes Aircraft Company to build a series of seven soft-landing vehicles, each weighing about 340 kilograms, to ﬁland gently on the moon, perform chemical analyses of the lunar surface and subsur-face and relay back to Earth television pictures of lunar features.ﬂ These vehicles were to be designed and built under the technical direction of JPL and launched in the period of 1963Œ1966. Unlike the Soviet Luna landers, Surveyor was a true soft-lander, comprising a three-meter tall vehicle based 
on a 27-kilogram thin-walled aluminum triangular 
structure with one of three legs at each corner and 
a large solid-propellant retro-rocket engine (that comprised over 60% of the spacecraft™s overall 
mass) in the center. The spacecraft was equipped 
with a Doppler velocity-sensing system that fed information into the spacecraft computer to imple-ment a controllable descent to the surface. Each of the three landing pads also carried aircraft-type shock absorbers and strain gauges to provide data 
on landing characteristics, important for future Apollo missions. Surveyor I, the first in the series, was an unprecedented success. NASA accom-plished the first true soft-landing on the Moon on its very first try when the probe landed in the southwestern region of the Ocean of Storms at 06:17:36 UT on 2 June 1966, just 63.6 hours after launch from Cape Canaveral. Touchdown coordi
-nates were announced as 2.46° S / 43.32° W, just 
14 kilometers from the planned target. At landing, 
the spacecraft weighed 294.3 kilograms. The initial panoramic views from the lunar surface indicated that Surveyor I was resting in a 100-kilometer diameter crater that contained boulders more than one meter scattered all around. The photos showed crestlines of low mountains in the distant horizon. The lander transmitted 11,240 high-resolution 591966
 images over two separate communications sessions by 6 July. Although the primary mission was com
-pleted by 14 July, NASA maintained contact until 
7 January 1967. Without doubt, Surveyor I was one 
of the great successes of NASA™s early lunar and 
interplanetary program.70Explorer XXXIII

6. magnetometer (from GSFC)7. solar cell damage experimentResults: It was hoped that Explorer XXXIII (33), also known as the Anchored Interplanetary Monitoring 
Platform (AIMP), would become the first U.S. spacecraft to enter lunar orbit (planned parameters were 1,300 × 6,440 kilometers at 175° inclina-tion), but the Thor Delta E-1 second stage accel-erated too rapidly, ensuring that lunar orbit would 
not be possible. Instead mission planners adopted an alternate mission which required the probe™s 
(Thiokol TE-M-458) 35.8 kgf thrust retro-rocket to 
fire about 6.5 hours after launch. Under the new plan, the spacecraft was put into a highly elliptical Earth orbit of 449,174 × 30,550 kilometers at 28.9° inclination. In this orbit, Explorer XXXIII was high enough to be perturbed by the Moon™s gravitation. 
In its new orbit, Explorer XXXIII approached the Moon (on its very first orbit) to a distance of 35,000 kilometers with subsequent close approaches in September, November, and December 1966 vary
-ing from 40,000 to 60,000 kilometers. During this time, the probe returned key data on Earth™s mag
-netic tail, the interplanetary magnetic field, and radiation. In January 1967, Goddard Space Flight Center engineers used an electric ﬁscrewdriverﬂ 
to restore power to the spacecraft after a tempo-rary blackout. The emergency repair was the most remote repair carried out on a spacecraft to date. The mission was declared a success by 1 January 
1967, although the spacecraft continued to return useful data until 15 September 1971.71Lunar Orbiter I

Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system2. micrometeoroid detectors3. radiation dosimetersResults: The Lunar Orbiter program originated as a response to the need to obtain one-meter resolu-tion photographs of potential Apollo landing sites. 
NASA planned launches of a series of three-axis stabilized spacecraft with four solar panels and a main engine (derived from an Apollo attitude 
control thruster) for lunar orbit insertion. The primary instrument on board was a 68-kilogram 60BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Eastman Kodak imaging system (using wide and narrow-angle lenses) that could develop exposed 
film, scan them, and send them back to Earth. In a twist that was not known until after the end of 
the Cold War, the Eastman Kodak camera flown on 
the Lunar Orbiters was originally developed by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and flown on the Samos E-1 spy satellite. The narrow-angle pictures taken by this system provided resolution up to 60 to 80 meters, while the wide-angle photos showed resolutions up to 0.5 kilometers. Lunar Orbiter I was launched into a parking orbit around 
Earth before its Agena upper stage fired at 20:04 
UT to insert it on a translunar trajectory. On the 
way to the Moon, the spacecraft™s Canopus star 
tracker failed to acquire its target, probably because the spacecraft™s structure was reflecting too much 
light. Flight controllers used a backup method by using the same sensor, but with the Moon to orient 
the vehicle. The vehicle also displayed higher than expected temperatures but successfully entered a 
1,866.8 × 189.1-kilometer orbit around the Moon on 24 August, thus becoming the first U.S. space
-craft to do so. The spacecraft™s primary mission 
was to photograph nine potential Apollo landing 
sites, seven secondary areas, and the Surveyor I landing site. By 28 August, Lunar Orbiter I had 
completed its main photography mission, having 
exposed a total of 205 frames, of which 38 were taken in the initial orbit and 167 in lower orbits, 
covering an area of 5.18 million km2. As planned, it 
photographed all 9 potential Apollo landing sites as 
well as 11 sites on the far side of the Moon. Some of the high-resolution photos were blurred due to smearing (stemming from problems in the imaging system), but the medium resolution images were the best lunar surface images returned to date. One of the images returned, unplanned but taken on 23˜August, was the first picture of Earth taken 
from the vicinity of the Moon. Lunar Orbiter I began an extended non-photography phase of its 
mission on 16 September that was focused on engi-neering goals, but by 28 October, the spacecraft™s 
condition had deteriorated. As such, the day after, 
on its 577th orbit, ground controllers commanded the orbiter to crash onto the lunar surface (at 13:30 UT) to prevent its transmissions from interfering with future Lunar Orbiters. Impact coordinates 
were 6° 42˜ N / 162° E.72Pioneer VIINation: USA (30)

a period of 402.95 days to study magnetic fields of solar origin, measure various characteristics of the solar wind, and distinguish between solar and galactic cosmic rays. On 17 August 1966, Pioneer 
VII flew through Earth™s magnetic tail region at 5.6 
million kilometer range from Earth, and discovered long periods when the solar wind was completely or partially blocked out, suggesting that its instru-ments were monitoring the end of an organized tail region. On 7 September 1968, the spacecraft was correctly aligned with the Sun and Earth to begin studying Earth™s magnetic tail. In 1977, 11 years 
after its launch, Pioneer VII registered the mag-netic tail 19.3 million kilometers out, three times further into space than recorded prior. At 23:36 UT,

Like Pioneer VI and Pioneer VIII, NASA maintained intermittent contact with Pioneer VII in the 1990s, more than 30 years after its mission began (with data returned from its cosmic ray detector and plasma analyzer in 
February 1991, for example). On 31 March 1995, 
the plasma analyzer was turned on during 2 hours of contact with the ground, this being the final con-tact made with the spacecraft.73Luna 11

spacecraft, the Ye-6LF, was designed to take the first 
photographs of the surface of the Moon from lunar 
orbit. A secondary objective was to obtain data on 
gravitational anomalies on the Moon (later identi-fied by U.S. researchers as ﬁmasconsﬂ) also detected 
by Luna 10. Using the basic Ye-6 bus, a suite of 
scientific instruments included an imaging system 
similar to the one used on Zond 3, which was capa
-ble of high- and low-resolution imaging and whose 
lenses faced the direction of the S5.5 main engine. 
This package replaced the small lander capsule 
used on the soft-landing flights. The resolution of 
the photos was reportedly 15 to 20 meters. A tech
-nological experiment included testing the efficiency 
of gear transmission in vacuum for the future Ye-8 
lunar rover (which worked successfully for 5 hours 
in vacuum). Luna 11, launched only two weeks 
after the U.S. Lunar Orbiter, successfully entered 
lunar orbit at 21:49 UT on 27 August about 5 min
-utes earlier than planned. Parameters were 163.5 
× 1,193.6 kilometers. Within 3 hours of lunar orbit 
insertion, the spacecraft was to be stabilized for its 
imaging mission which would include taking 42 
frames taken over a 64-minute session. Due to an 
off-nominal position of the vehicle, the camera only 
took images (64 of them) of blank space. Investiga-tors determined that a foreign object had probably 
been dislodged in the nozzle of one of the attitude 
control thrusters. The other instruments functioned 
without fault (although no data was returned by the 
spectrophotometer) before the mission formally 
ended on 1 October 1966 after power supply had 
been depleted.74Surveyor II

to Earth. The Soviet press released the first photos taken of the surface on 29 October, pictures that 
showed the Sea of Rains and the Aristarchus crater. 
Resolution was as high as 15Œ20 meters. No fur-ther photos were released at the time, although apparently 42 total images were obtained. After

Results: Lunar Orbiter II™s mission was to photo
-graph 13 primary and 17 secondary landings sites 
for the Apollo program in the northern region of 
the Moon™s near side equatorial area. After a single 
mid-course correction on the way to the Moon, 

on 10 November 1966, the spacecraft entered 

a 196 × 1,850 kilometer orbit around the Moon. 
After 33 orbits, Lunar Orbiter II was moved to its 
photographic orbit with a perilune of 49.7 kilome-ters; on 18 November, it began its photography 

mission, returning excellent quality medium and 
high-resolution photographs, including the impact 
point of Ranger VIII. The spacecraft ended its pho-tography mission on 26 November and transmission 

of the images was concluded by 7 December, by 
which time the probe had transmitted back 211 pic
-
tures of both the near side and large areas of the far-side. These photos covered nearly four million km2 of the lunar surface. The high-gain transmitter failed 

during this time, but did not significantly affect the 
coverage afforded by the photos. On 23˜November, 
Lunar Orbiter II took perhaps the most memorable 

photo of any in the series, a spectacular shot look
-ing across the Copernicus crater from an altitude 
of only 45 kilometers that vividly emphasized the 
three-dimensional nature of the lunar surface. On 

8 December, after the main photographic mission 

was over, Lunar Orbiter II fired its main engine to 
64BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
change its orbital plane in order to provide tracking 
data of the Moon™s gravitational field over a wider 
swath. Finally, on 11 October 1967, when atti
-tude control gas was almost depleted, a retro-burn deliberately crashed the spacecraft onto the lunar surface at 4° S / 98° E on the farside to prevent communications interference on future missions.77Luna 13Nation: USSR (45)

It began its mission by entering an ini-tial Earth orbit of 223 × 171 kilometers at 51.8° inclination. The Blok L upper stage soon fired to send the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon. After a routine course correction on 22 December, 
Luna 13 began its approach to our only natural sat-ellite. The retro-rocket engine fired at 17:59 UT on 24˜December about 70 kilometers above the 
surface. Within two minutes, by 18:01 UT, Luna 
13 was safely on the lunar surface, having landed in the Ocean of Storms between the Krafft and Seleucus craters at 18° 52
˜ N / 62° 04
˜ W, some 
440 kilometers from Luna 9. The first signal from the probe was received at 18:05:30 UT. Unlike its 
predecessor, the heavier Luna 13 lander (113 kilo
-grams) carried a suite of scientific instruments in addition to the usual imaging system. A three-axis 
accelerometer within the pressurized frame of the lander recorded the landing forces during impact to determine the regolith structure down to a depth of 20Œ30 centimeters. A pair of spring-loaded booms 
(not carried on Luna 9) capable of extending 1.5 meters beyond the lander, was also deployed. One 
of these was equipped with the RP radiation den
-sitometer for determining the composition of the lunar surface, and the other with the GR-1 pen-etrometer to investigate the mechanical strength of the soil. At 18:06 UT, a small solid-propellant 
motor fired and forced the GR-1 instrument, a 3.5-centimeter diameter titanium-tipped rod, into 
the lunar surface. The instrument recorded how fast and how far into the soil (4.5 centimeters) the probe penetrated, thus helping scientists gain valu-able information for future landers. At the same 
time, the RP densitometer emitted gamma quanta from a cesium-137 sample into the soil. The result-ing scattering was then recorded by three indepen-dent pickups to provide an estimate of the density of the soil, found to be about 0.8 g/cm3. In addi-tion, four radiometers recorded infrared radiation from the surface indicating a noon temperature of 117±3°C while a radiation detector indicated that radiation levels would be less than hazardous for humans. The lander returned a total of five pan-oramas of the lunar surface, showing a terrain smoother than that seen by Luna 9. One of the two cameras (intended to help return stereo images) 
failed but this did not diminish the quality of the photographs. A fully successful mission concluded 
with a last communications session between 04:05 UT and 06:13˜UT on 28 December when the 
onboard batteries were˜exhausted.651967

sites although its mission was focused on ﬁsite con-firmationﬂ rather than ﬁsite search.ﬂ For the mission, 
the spacecraft™s orbital inclination was increased to 
21° to ensure photography both north and south of the lunar equator. Building on the stereo pho
-tography taken by Lunar Orbiter II, the third mis-sion was focused on making two ﬁfootprintsﬂ of the same area on two successive orbits. Lunar Orbiter III was also designed to obtain precision trajectory 
information for defining the lunar gravitational 
field, measure micrometeoroid flux, and measure radiation dosage levels around the Moon. The spacecraft arrived in lunar orbit after a 9 minute 2.5 second engine burn on 8 February 1967 after a 
single mid-course correction. Initial orbital param-eters were 210.2 × 1,801.9 kilometers at 20.93° inclination. About four days later, the spacecraft

was still in operation around the Moon, thus pro-viding key experience for NASA™s ability to track 
and communicate with two simultaneous space-craft around the Moon. Lunar Orbiter III began its photographic mission on 15 February. The space
-craft exposed 211 (out of a possible 212) frames of pictures by the time that imaging concluded on 23 February. Soon, the spacecraft began to ﬁread 
outﬂ the images to the ground but this activity suddenly stopped on 4 March due to a problem with the film advance mechanism in the read-out section of the imaging system. As such, only 
182 images were returnedŠ72 others were never read out to the ground. Despite the glitch, Lunar Orbiter wholly fulfilled its original mission objec
-tives, returning images of 15.5 million km2 of the near side and 650,000 km
2 of the farside. One of 
its images showed the Surveyor II lander on the lunar surface. On 30 August 1967, ground control
-lers commanded the vehicle to circularize its orbit to 160 kilometers in order to simulate an Apollo 
trajectory. Later, on 9 October 1967, the probe was 
intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface at 14° 36˜ N / 91° 42˜ W. The photographs from the first 
three Lunar Orbiters allowed NASA scientists to pick eight preliminary landing sites for Apollo by 
early April 1967, including site 2 in the Sea of 
Tranquility where Apollo 11 would land and site 5 
in the Ocean of Storms where Apollo 12 (and also 
Surveyor III) would disembark.66BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016

Launch Date and Time: 
17 April 1967 / 07:05:01 UT
Launch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 36B
Scientific Instruments:1. TV camera2. surface samplerResults: Surveyor III was the third engineering flight 
of the series, but for the first time carried a sur-face-sampling instrument that could reach up to 1.5 
meters from the lander and dig up to 18 centimeters 
deep. Unlike the previous Surveyors, Surveyor III 
began its mission from parking orbit around Earth 
with a burn from the Centaur upper stage, now 

capable of multiple firings. During the descent to the 

lunar surface, highly reflective rocks confused the 
lander™s descent radar, and the main engine failed to 
cut off at the correct moment at about 4.3-meters 

altitude. As a result, Surveyor III bounced off the 

lunar surface twice, the first time to a height of 10 
meters and the second time, to 3 meters. The third 
time, the lander settled down to a soft-landing at 

00:04:17 UT on 20 April 1967 in the south-eastern 

region of Oceanus Procellarum at 3.0° S / 23.41° W. 
Less than an hour after landing, the spacecraft began 
transmitting the first of 6,326 TV pictures of the 

surrounding areas. The most exciting experiments 

of the mission included deployment of the surface 
sampler for digging trenches, making bearing tests, 
and manipulating lunar material in the view of the 

TV system. Via commands from Earth, it dug four 

trenches, and performed four bearing tests and thir
-teen impact tests. Based on these experiments, sci-entists concluded that lunar soil had a consistency 

similar to wet sand, with a bearing strength of 0.7 

kilograms/cm2, i.e., solid enough for an Apollo Lunar 
Module. The lander™s TV camera consisted of two 25 

and 100 mm focal length lenses and was mounted 
under a mirror that could be moved horizontally and 
vertically. It took about 20 seconds to transmit a 

single 200-line picture of the surface. The camera 

was also capable of 600-line images which used dig-ital picture transmission. Last contact was made on 

4˜May 1967, two days after the lunar night began. 

More than three years later, on 18 November 1969, 

Apollo 12 astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr. and Alan 
L. Bean landed the Intrepid Lunar Module approx
-imately 180 meters from the inactive Surveyor III 
lander. During their second extra-vehicular activity 

(EVA) on 19 November, the astronauts walked over 
to Surveyor III and recovered parts, including the 
soil scoop and camera system, to allow scientists to 

evaluate the effects of nearly two-and-a-half years of 

exposure on the Moon™s surface.

4 May 1967 / 22:25:00 UT
Launch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 13
Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system2. micrometeoroid detectors3. radiation dosimetersResults: Lunar Orbiter IV was the first in the series 
dedicated to scientific surveys of the Moon. Its 
goal was to acquire contiguous photographic cov
-erage of the lunar surface of at least 80% of the 
near side at 50Œ100-meter resolution. After a mid-
course correction on 5 May 1967, Lunar Orbiter 
IV fired its engine at 15:08 UT on 8 May to insert 
the spacecraft into an initial lunar polar orbit of 
6,111 × 2,706 kilometers at 85.5° inclination, thus 
becoming the first spacecraft to go into polar orbit 
around the Moon. Orbital period was about 12 
hours. The spacecraft began its photographic mis-sion at 15:46 UT on 11 May. A potentially serious 
problem threatened the mission when on 13 May, 
controllers found a problem with a camera thermal 
door that failed to close, leaking light onto exposed 
images. They were able to devise a fix that worked 
and the spacecraft continued its imaging mission. 
During its two-month mission, Lunar Orbiter IV 
took pictures of 99% of the near side and 75% of 
the farside of the Moon in a total of 163 frames. 
The imaging mission ended on the orbiter™s 34th 
orbit due to worsening readout difficulties. For
-tunately, all but 30 of the 163 images collected, 
many with a resolution down to 60 meters, were 
successfully transmitted to Earth by 1 June. In 
early June, controllers lowered the spacecraft™s 
orbit to match that of Lunar Orbiter V so that sci-entists could collect gravitational data in support of 
the latter mission. Before losing contact on 17˜July, 
Lunar Orbiter IV took the first photos of the lunar 
south pole and discovered a 240-kilometer long 
crustal fault on the farside. Since contact was lost 
before controlled impact, the spacecraft naturally 
crashed onto the Moon on 6 October 1967 due to 
gravitational anomalies.81Kosmos 159 [Luna]

Results: This spacecraft was a one-off high apogee

of telemetry and communications equipment, the 
vehicle also carried a transceiver as part of the

equipment designed to work with the new Saturn-MS-DRK ground station located near the village 
of Saburovo, about 10 kilometers from NIP-14, a 
station, close to Moscow, belonging to the Soviet 
ground-based tracking network. The spacecraft 
was similar to Luna 11 but had a slightly length-ened (by 15 cm) instrument container so as to 
accommodate the modified DRK and new BR-9-7

to send the probe into a highly elliptical orbit with 

an apogee of 250,000 kilometers, but the Blok L 
upper stage cut off too early. Instead, the space
-craft, named Kosmos 159, entered a lower orbit 
of 380 × 60,600 kilometers at 51.5° inclination. 

Despite the incorrect orbit, controllers were able 
to accomplish the original mission, carried out 
over a period of nine days during which it was 

discovered that the energy potential of the UHF 

downlink from the spacecraft to the ground was 
1Œ2 orders magnitude below the calculated value.

6. KS-18-2M cosmic ray particle counters7. LA-2 spectrometerResults: Venera 4 was the first spacecraft to transmit 
data from a planet™s atmosphere. It was also the first 
Venus probe built by the Lavochkin design bureau, 
although Lavochkin engineers retained the basic 
design layout of the earlier 3MV probes built under 
Chief Designer Sergey Korolev (1907Œ1966). The 
spacecraft consisted of a main bus about 3.5 meters 
high and a 383-kilogram lander probe designed to 
transmit data as it descended through the Venusian 
atmosphere. This capsule could endure loads as 
high as 300 g™s and land on both land and liquid. 
For atmospheric entry it was equipped with a thick 
ablative heatshield. Launch, for the first time, used 
an upgraded Blok L (4th stage), the Blok VL. After 
a mid-course correction on 29 July 1967, Venera 4 
approached Venus on 18 October. About 2 hours 
before arrival at Venus, at a distance of 45,000 kilo
-meters, on command from Earth, the spacecraft 
was properly oriented for entry. The bus released 
the lander at 04:34 UT, and the latter entered the 
Venusian atmosphere at a velocity of 11 kilometers/
second. The bus returned data for some time before 
being destroyed in the atmosphere. The lander, 
meanwhile experienced as much as 300 g™s and 
reduced its speed to 210 meters/second at which 
point the parachute system was deployed. Simul-taneously, the lander began to transmit information 
back to Earth. Because the altimeter was designed 
to record pressures only up to 7.3 atmospheres, it 
went off-scale rather quickly. Temperature mea
-surements (from 33°C to 262°C) continued to 
come back for 93 minutes as the probe slowly 
descended through the atmosphere. Initially, Soviet 
scientists believed that the probe transmitted until 
contact with the surface, announcing that ﬁa cal-culation of the rate of descent of the station until 
termination of transmission of data indicates that 
it continued transmitting until it actually touched 
the surface of the planet.ﬂ Later analysis of data 
showed that transmissions ceased at an altitude of 
28 kilometers when the high atmospheric pressure 
and temperatures damaged the probe. The inert 
probe impacted the surface near 19° N / 36° E. The 
data implied that surface temperatures and pres-sure were 500°C and 75 atmospheres respectively. 
Venera 4™s gas analyzers also found that the plan
-et™s atmosphere was composed of 90Œ95% carbon 
dioxide (with a sensitivity of ±7%) with no nitro
-gen, which had previously been assumed would 
constitute most of the atmosphere. Data from the 
ionizing densitometer showed that cloud cover in 
the Venusian atmosphere exists at altitudes below 
52 kilometers with the lower boundary at roughly 
35 kilometers. The spacecraft bus measured the 
planet™s weak magnetic field and found no ring of 
radiation belts. It detected a very weak atmosphere 
of atomic hydrogen about 9,900 kilometers above 
the planet. Noteworthy was Venera 4™s detection 
of the planet™s bow shock, identified a day before 
by Mariner V (and later confirmed by Venera 5). 
The mission™s importance was underscored when 
NASA Administrator James E. Webb (1906Œ1992) 
issued a statement on 18 October˚1967, noting 
that the landing ﬁrepresents an accomplishment 
any nation can be proud of.ﬂ Researchers at NASA 
Ames Research Center were particularly interested 
in data from Venera 4, especially the effect of plane
-tary atmosphere on the propagation of radio signals 
from the spacecraft, in anticipation of future NASA 
missions to Venus.

Scientific Instruments:1. ultraviolet photometer2. S-band occultation experiment3. dual frequency occultation experiment4. solar plasma probe5. magnetometer6. trapped radiation detector7. celestial mechanics experimentResults: In December 1965, NASA approved a proj-ect to modify the Mariner IV backup spacecraft to conduct a closer flyby of Venus than the only 
other NASA probe to fly past Venus, Mariner II. 
The primary goal of the mission was to conduct a radio-occultation experiment (much like Mariner IV at Mars) to determine atmospheric properties of Venus. Unlike Mariner IV, however, Mariner 
V did not carry an imaging instrument. Initially, 
NASA had planned to send Mariner V on a flyby at a miss distance of 8,165 kilometers to the surface, but the Agency altered its plan in favor of a more 
modest 75,000-kilometer flyby in order to preclude the non-sterilized vehicle from crashing into the 
planet. After a mid-course correction on 19 June, 
Mariner V began transmitting data on Venus on 
19˜October during its encounter. Closest approach 
was at 17:34:56 UT at a range of 4,094 kilome-ters, much closer than expected due to the course correction. Mariner V found that although Venus 
does not have a magnetic field, the dense daylight ionosphere produces a bow shock that deflects 
the solar wind around the planet. The ultraviolet photometer detected a hydrogen corona (as found by the Soviet Venera 4) but no oxygen emission. 
Mariner V™s instruments indicated that the planet™s 
surface temperature and pressure were 527°C and 75 to 100 atmospheres, respectivelyŠwhich coun-tered the Soviet claim that its Venera 4 spacecraft 
had managed to transmit from the planet™s surface. 
The encounter with Venus deflected the spacecraft 
towards the Sun, and Mariner V entered solar orbit 
with parameters ranging from 0.579 AU and 0.735 
AU. On 4 December 1967, NASA lost contact with 
the spacecraft although controllers briefly regained contact on 14 October 1968. The spacecraft did 
not transmit any further telemetry and NASA even-tually stopped attempts (on 5 November 1968) to communicate with the vehicle, now in heliocentric orbit. Planetary scientists reviewed data from both Mariner V and the Soviet Venera 4 at a conference 
at Kitt Peak National Observatory in March 1968, 
one of the first major international meetings to dis-cuss the results of planetary exploration. Scientists concluded that neither Mariner V or Venera 4 had 
been entirely successful in communicating data about conditions at the planet™s surface.

Results: Explorer XXXV (35) also known as the

-planetary space phenomena, particularly the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field, dust dis-tribution near the Moon, the lunar gravitational field, the weak lunar ionosphere, and the radiation 
environment. The spacecraft left Earth on a direct 
ascent trajectory and entered lunar orbit on 21 July 1967 after a 23-second burn. The main engine sep
-arated 2 hours later, the spacecraft having entered 
an initial elliptical orbit of 800 × 7,692 kilome-ters at 147° inclination. The spacecraft, similar to Explorer XXXIII, which had failed to achieve lunar orbit, found that the Moon has no magnetosphere, 
that solar wind particles impact directly onto the 72BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
surface, and that the Moon creates a ﬁcavityﬂ in the solar wind stream. After six years of successful 
operation, the satellite was turned off on 24˜June 
1973. The lunar satellite later impacted on the surface, although the precise location remains unknown. Explorer XXXV was launched by the fif-tieth Thor Delta booster, of which only three had 
failed to date, giving it a success rating of 94%.87Lunar Orbiter V

Launch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 13
Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system2. micrometeoroid detectors3. radiation dosimetersResults: Lunar Orbiter V was the last in a series of highly successful missions to map the Moon for potential landing sites and conduct general 
observational surveys. This last mission™s objec
-tives were both photographic (the primary mis
-sion) and non-photographic (the secondary). The former involved taking additional pictures of Apollo 
sites, broad surveys of unphotographed areas of the 
farside, imaging the Surveyor landing sites, and photographic areas of scientific value. The sec-ondary goals included acquisition of precise tra-jectory information for improving the definition of the lunar gravitational field, measurement of the micrometeoroid flux and radiation dose in the lunar environment, and helping to prepare the Manned 
Space Flight Network for the Apollo missions. 
After a single mid-course correction on 3 August, 
Lunar Orbiter V entered lunar polar orbit two days later after an engine firing at 16:48 UT that lasted 8 minutes, 28 seconds. Initial orbital parameters were 194.5 × 6,023 kilometers at 85.01° inclination. The orbital period was 8.5 hours. Lunar Orbiter V began its photography mission at 01:22˜UT on 
7˜August before executing a maneuver to bring it to 
its operational orbit at 100 × 6,023 kilometers. The spacecraft photographed 36 different areas on the 
near side and mapped most of the farside via a set of 212 frames until the photography mission ended on 18 August. These included five potential Apollo 
landing sites, 36 science sites, and 23 previously 
unphotographed areas of the farside, as well pos
-sible targets for future Surveyor missions. Control-lers also extensively used the spacecraft to map the Moon™s gravitational field in order to predict orbital 
perturbations on future lunar orbital missions. The probe also obtained a spectacular high-quality photo of Earth showing Africa, the Middle East, 
and parts of Africa at 09:05 UT on 8˜August 1967. 
A further orbital change on 9˜August brought the 
orbit down to 1,499.37 × 98.93 kilometers at 84.76° inclination. Lunar Orbiter V was commanded to impact on the lunar surface on 31 January 1968, which it did at 0° N / 70° W. In total, the five Lunar 
Orbiters photographed 99% of the lunar surface. Perhaps the most important finding credited to 
data from the Lunar Orbiters (and Lunar Orbiter V, 
in particular) is the discovery of ﬁmasconsﬂ or lunar mass concentrations under the lunar ringed maria, first published by JPL researchers P.˜M. Muller 
and W. L. Sjogren in mid-1968.

Scientific Instruments:1. TV camera2. alpha-scattering instrument3. footpad magnetResults: Surveyor V was similar to its predecessor 
but the surface sampler from the earlier vehicle 
was replaced by an alpha-backscatter instrument 
to determine the relative abundance of the chemi-cal elements in lunar material. In addition, a small 
bar magnet was installed on one of the lander™s 
footpads to indicate whether the lunar soil had 
magnetic properties. Overcoming a near-fatal 
helium leak in a pressure regulator, engineers 
from JPL and Hughes Aircraft Company (the 
prime contractor for the spacecraft) expertly man-aged to safely land Surveyor V on the surface of 
the Moon in the south-eastern region of Mare 
Tranquilitatis at 1.42° N / 23.20° E at 00:46:42 
UT on 11˜September 1967. The malfunction put 
the lander about 29 kilometers away from its target 
in an angular incline within the slope of rimless 
crater. Surveyor V was, however, the most suc
-cessful of the series so far. The lander returned 
18,006 photos before lunar night descended on 
24˜September. Controllers successfully com
-manded the vehicle to take a further 1,000 pho
-tographs during the second lunar day between 15 
and 24 October 1967 and the fourth lunar day in 
December. In total, 20,018 pictures were trans
-mitted. In a new experiment, on 13 September 
controllers fired the main engine for 0.55 seconds 
to examine the effects of disturbing the lunar sur-face. NASA announced that no new craters were 
created, nor was there any significant dust cloud 
due to the firing. The alpha-scattering instrument 
had earlier been activated and found the soil to be 
composed of more than half oxygen with various 
amounts of silicon and aluminum. Contact was 
lost with the lander on 16 December 1967.89[Zond, 7K-L1 no. 4L]

Results: This spacecraft, a 7K-L1 type, was the first of a series of spacecraft that the Soviets tried to send on circumlunar missions as part of a larger project to send two cosmonauts around the Moon. The program, which was officially approved in October 1965, involved combining forces between two of the leading space organizations in the Soviet Union, those headed by Vasiliy Mishin (1917Œ
2001) (who provided the 7K-L1 spaceship and the Blok D translunar injection stage) and Vladimir Chelomey (1914Œ1984) (who provided the 3-stage Proton-K launch vehicle). The 7K-L1 spacecraft was a stripped-down version of the larger 7K-OK Soyuz spacecraft intended for Earth-orbital opera-tions. The proximate goal was to send two cosmo-nauts around the Moon by the fiftieth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, in November 1967. 
The project moved into a new stage with two tech-nological flights in Earth orbit in March and April 
1967, which involved high-speed reentries. During 
this particular launch, the ascent was steady for 61 seconds before diverting from a nominal path, which activated the emergency rescue system into action. The 7K-LI descent module immediately separated from the wandering launch vehicle, and although the capsule was destabilized at the moment of separation because of an unexpected 
pressure shock, it landed safely in one piece not far 74BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016

Scientific Instruments:1. TV camera2. alpha-scattering instrument3. footpad magnetsResults: Surveyor VI landed safely on the Moon at 01:01:04 UT on 10 November 1967 in the Sinus 
Medii (Central Bay) at coordinates announced as 0.46° N / 1.37° W (but probably closer to 0.473° N /  1.427° W). The spacecraft returned 29,952 images of the lunar surface during less than two weeks of operation before the onset of lunar night on 24 November, because of which the spacecraft 
was placed in hibernation mode on 26 November. 
During its initial operations, the alpha-scattering 
instrument acquired about 30 hours of data on the chemical composition of the lunar surface. Although controllers regained contact briefly on 14˜December 1967, primary landing operations 
had ceased by this time. Before termination of 
operations, on 17 November 1967, Surveyor VI was commanded to fire its three main liquid pro-pellant thrusters for 2.5 seconds. As a result, the 
lander became the first spacecraft to be launched 
from the lunar surface. Surveyor VI lifted up to 
about three meters before landing two-and-a-half meters west of its original landing point. Cameras then studied the original landing footprints in order to determine the soil™s mechanical properties and 
also accomplish some stereo imaging, now that the source point had been displaced. Surveyor VI also sent back pictures of the bar magnet at the footpad 
allowing investigators to determine the concentra-tion of magnetic material in the lunar surface.91[Zond, 7K-L1 no. 5L]

Results: This was the second Soviet attempt at a robotic circumlunar mission as part of a larger proj-ect to send cosmonauts around the Moon. On this launch, one of the four second stage engines of the Proton-K rocket failed to ignite at T+125.5 seconds due to a break in the engine nozzle. The wayward booster was then destroyed on command from the ground at T+129.9 seconds. Once again, the emer
-gency rescue system was activated, shooting the 7K-L1 descent module away from the rocket. The 
capsule landed by parachute about 80 kilometers southwest of the town of Dzhezkazgan. The actual impact was a hard one because of a spurious com-mand from the altimeter which fired the capsule™s 
soft-landing engines at an altitude of 4.5 kilometers instead of a few meters above the ground.751967

sent into heliocentric orbit to study interplanetary space, particularly to carry collect information on magnetic fields, plasma, and cosmic rays for two or more passages of solar activity. Although the 
spacecraft carried a different complement of sci-entific instruments than Pioneers VI and VII, its findings were correlated with the other two probes. The spacecraft was launched into a path ahead of Earth to provide the vehicle with added veloc-ity in solar orbit to move out beyond Earth™s orbit 
at 1.0080 × 0.9892. AU. Pioneer VIII arrived at 
Earth™s magnetospheric bounds at 19:00 UT on 
15˜December 1967. Later, on 18 January 1968, the 
probe, the Sun, and Earth were perfectly aligned to allow investigation of Earth™s magnetic tail in 
detail, first performed by Pioneer VII in 1968. Already by June 1968, data from the probe led scientists to speculate that Earth™s magnetic tail 
might be shorter than the 320 million kilometers 
suggested by theoretical calculations. In August of 
the same year, NASA scientists at the Deep Space 
Network (DSN) announced that they had man-aged to quadruple the distance over which signals 
from the three solar Pioneers so far launched could be heard. These improvements were enabled by changes in the DSN receivers. In October 1982, Pioneers VIII and IX came within 2.4 million kilo-meters of each other, an ﬁencounterﬂ used to reca
-librate Pioneer VIII™s damaged plasma instrument. 
Controllers intermittently maintained contact with the spacecraft for nearly 30 years although only one instrument, the electric field detector, 
remained operational past 1982. During tracking on 23 July 1995, NASA was unable to switch on Pioneer VIII™s transmitter, probably because the 
spacecraft was too far away from the Sun to charge the solar panels. On 22˜August 1996, contact was 
reacquired via a backup transmitter. Although 
there were no further plans to contact the space
-craft, the on-board electric field detector remained at least hypothetically functional in 2015, nearly 48 years after launch. The original launch vehicle also carried a second payload, the Tts I (Test and 
Training Satellite I, later renamed Tetr I), fixed to 
the second stage, which was successfully ejected after the third stage finished firing, and entered an Earth orbit of 488 × 301 kilometers at 33° inclina-tion. It reentered on 14 May 1968.771968

Launch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 36A
Scientific Instruments:1. TV camera2. alpha-scattering instrument3. surface sampler4. footpad magnets5. stereoscopic and dust detection mirrorsResults: Since Surveyors I, III, V, and VI successfully 
fulfilled requirements in support of Apollo, NASA 
opted to use the last remaining Surveyor for a purely scientific mission outside of a potential landing site for the early Apollo flights. After an uneventful 
coast to the Moon (including one of two planned mid-course corrections), Surveyor VII successfully 
set down at 01:05:36.3 UT on 10 January 1968 on the ejecta blanket emanating from the bright Tycho 
crater in the south of the nearside. Landing coordi-nates were 40.97° S / 11.44°˜W, about 29 kilome
-ters north of Tycho™s rim, and 2.4 kilometers from 
its target. Initial photos from the surface showed surprisingly few craters, much like the mare sites, although the general area was rougher. About 21 
hours after landing, ground controllers fired pyro-technic charges to drop the alpha-scattering instru-ment on the lunar surface. When the instrument failed to move beyond an intermediate position, controllers used the surface sampler (robot arm) to force it down. The sampler was then used to pick up the alpha-scattering instrument after its first chemical analysis and move it to two additional locations. About 66 hours of alpha-scattering data 
were obtained during the first lunar day on three 
samples: the undisturbed lunar surface, a Moon rock, and an area dug up by the surface sampler. 
The alpha-scattering instrument collected 34 more hours of data during the second lunar day. The 
scoop on the sampler™s arm was used numerous 
times for picking up soil and digging trenches, and for conducting at least 16 surface-bearing tests. Apart from taking 21,274 photographs (20,993 
on the first lunar day and 45 during the second), Surveyor VII also served as a target for Earth-
based lasers (of 1 watt power) to accurately mea-sure the distance between Earth and the Moon. Communications were paused with Surveyor VII at 14:12 UT on 26 January 1968, about 80 hours after sunset. Second lunar day operations began at 
19:01 UT on 12 February 1968, and extended to 
00:24 UT on 21 February effectively ending the 
mission. In total, the five successful Surveyors 
returned more than 87,000 photos of the lunar sur-face and operated for about 17 months total on the lunar surface, and most important, demonstrated the feasibility of soft-landing a spacecraft on the lunar surface. Originally planned as a 7-spacecraft series, in 1963, NASA added 3 more missions (Surveyors H, I, and J) for a total of 10 missions. 
These later Surveyors, each weighing 1,134 kilo
-grams (as opposed to the 998-kilogram model), 
were, however, canceled in December 1966 based 
on the successful results of the Ranger missions, Lunar Orbiters, and Surveyors already launched by˜then.78BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016

Results: The Soviets decided to send this next 
7K-L1 spacecraft not on a circumlunar flight, but to about 330,000 kilometers into deep space in 
the opposite direction of the Moon in order to test the main spacecraft systems without the perturb-ing effects of the Moon, much like the Surveyor model test flights in 1965Œ1966. After returning 
from its high apogee, the spacecraft would carry out a high-speed reentry into Earth™s atmosphere 
and be recovered and investigated for the effects of reentry. After launch into Earth orbit, at T+71 min
-utes and 56 seconds, the Blok D upper stage fired a second time (for 459 seconds) to send the 7K-L1 
on a highly elliptical Earth orbit with an apogee of 
354,000 kilometers. The Soviet news agency TASS 
publicly named the spacecraft ﬁZond˜4,ﬂ thus con
-necting the mission with a series of completely unrelated deep space probesŠa typically obfuscat-ing maneuver from the Soviet media. Controllers were unable to carry out a mid-course correction at 04:53 UT on 4 March when a star sensor (the 100K) of the attitude control system failed. A second 
attempt also failed the following day and the main omni-directional antenna also did not deploy fully, 
compromising communications. A third attempt at 
a correction proved successful, by using a special filter on the sensor to read signals accurately. After 
the spacecraft separated into its two constituent parts, however, the descent module was unable to 
maintain a stable and proper attitude for a guided reentry, instead moving into a ballistic reentry tra
-jectory, entering the atmosphere at 18:18:58 UT on 
9 March. A crew on board would have experienced 
about 20 g™s but probably would have survived. 
However, because the descent module was falling 
into an unanticipated area, to prevent ﬁforeignﬂ observers from recovering the wayward spacecraft, an automatic emergency destruct system destroyed the returning capsule at an altitude of 10Œ15 kilo
-meters over the Gulf of Guinea. For some years, 
the official Soviet press claimed that Zond 4 had entered heliocentric orbit.791968

1968), was to test communications systems in sup

Results: After three failures, the Soviets tried again to accomplish a robotic circumlunar mission. Besides a complement of sensors to monitor its basic systems and cameras, the spacecraft also car-ried a large biological payload: two Steppe tortoises (Testudo horsfieldi
 or the Horsfield™s tortoise), each 
with a mass of 0.34 to 0.40 kilograms, hundreds of Drosophila eggs of the Domodedovo-32 line; air-
dried cells of wheat, barley, peas, carrots, and toma
-toes; a flowering plant of 
Tradescantia paludosa
, three different strains of chlorella, and a culture of lysogenic bacteria. The tortoises, each 6Œ7 years old and weighing 340Œ400 grams, were part of a 
group of eight, with the other six serving as controls on the ground. The two flight tortoises were placed in the Zond 6 spacecraft on September 2, 12 days before launch. From that moment on, they (and 
two of the control group) were deprived of food to ensure that the only effect on them was due to the space mission. The ascent to orbit was perfect: the 7K-L1 spacecraft + Blok D combination success
-fully entered a 191 × 219-kilometer Earth orbit. About 67 minutes after launch, the Blok D fired again for lunar injection, after which the Soviet press announced the mission as ﬁZond 5.ﬂ Once again, the 100K star sensor of the spacecraft™s atti
-tude control system failed (due to contamination of its exposed surface). Controllers, however, man
-aged to carry out a mid-course correction at 03:11 UT on 17˜September using the less accurate solar 
and Earth-directed sensors. At the time, Zond 5 was 
325,000 kilometers from Earth. The spacecraft suc-cessfully circled around the farside of the Moon at a range of 1,950 kilometers on 18 September, taking 
spectacular high-resolution photos of the Moon and Earth. On the return leg of the flight, a second attitude control sensor (the 101K that used Earth for attitude control reference) failed and the space-craft™s three-axis stabilization platform switched off 
the guided reentry system. As a result, controllers 
were forced to maintain reentry attitude using the one remaining sensor (the 99K that used the Sun); they alternately fired two attitude control jets on 
each side of the vehicle to swing the spacecraft into the proper reentry corridor for a direct ballistic reentry into the backup target area in the Indian Ocean. Zond 5™s descent module successfully 
splashed down in the Indian Ocean at 32° 38˜ S /  65° 33˜ E, about 105 kilometers from the near-est Soviet tracking ship. Landing time was 16:08 
UT on 21 September, making it a mission lasting 
6 days, 18 hours, and 24 minutes. It was the first successful circumlunar mission carried out by any nation. The tortoises survived the trip and arrived back in Moscow on 7 October. The results of dis
-section, performed on 11 October after ﬁa 39-day fast,ﬂ showed that ﬁthe main structural changes in the tortoises were caused by starvationﬂ rather than flight to lunar distance or the subsequent travel back from the Indian Ocean to˜Moscow.

Soon after trans-lunar injec-tion, which happened at 20:18:30 UT on launch day, ground controllers discovered that the vehi
-cle™s high-gain antenna had failed to deploy. Given 
that the main attitude control sensor was installed 
on the antenna boom, controllers had to make plans to use a backup sensor for further attitude control. After a mid-course correction at 05:41 UT 
on 12˜November (at a distance of 246,000 kilo
-meters), the spacecraft circled the farside of the Moon at a closest range of 2,420 kilometers, taking high resolution black-and-white photographs of the Moon at a range of 11,000 and 3,300 kilometers. During the return flight, temperatures in a hydro-gen peroxide tank for the attitude control thrust-ers dropped far below acceptable levels. Engineers attempted to heat the tank by direct sunlight, but 
as they later discovered, such a procedure affected the weak pressurization seal of the main hatch and led to slow decompression of the main capsule, which would have undoubtedly killed a crew on board. Despite the failures, Zond 6 conducted two 
mid-course corrections (on 16 November at 06:40 UT and 17 November at 05:36 UT), and then successfully carried out a fully automated guided 
reentry, requiring two successive ﬁdipsﬂ into the 
atmosphere, each reducing velocity significantly (the first from 11.2 kilometers/second to 7.6 kilo-meters/second, and the second down to just 200 meters/second) and headed for the primary land
-ing zone in Kazakhstan. Each of the ﬁdipsﬂ was automatically and expertly controlled by attitude 
control jets to vary roll control so as to provide lift and reduce g-loads. The Zond 6 descent module experienced a maximum of only 4 to 7 g™s. After the 
successful reentry, a gamma-ray altimeter, detect
-ing the now practically depressurized spacecraft (with pressure down to only 25 millibars), issued a command to jettison the main parachute at an altitude of about 5.3 kilometers instead of much lower. As a result, the spacecraft plummeted down 
to the ground and was destroyed, with impact

-craft designed to penetrate Venus™ atmosphere and 
transmit a variety of scientific data back to Earth during descent. Both spacecraft were targeted to reach Venus only a day apart, thus allowing 
some cross-calibration of data. The bus was basi-cally similar in design to the Venera 4 bus but the 
410-kilogram lander had some significant alter-ations. Because of data from Venera 4, the new 
lander was designed to survive pressures as high as 25 atmospheres and temperatures as high as 
320°C. These changes forced a fairly significant increase in the structural strength of the lander, 
increasing its mass by 27 kilograms. This is why the mass of the spacecraft bus was reduced by 14 kilo-grams by removing the SG 59 magnetometer). The 
main and drogue parachutes were also reduced in size, thus reducing the time to descend to the sur
-face. The new lander weighted 410 kilograms and was designed to endure g-loads as high as 450 (as compared to 300 for their predecessors). After per
-forming 73 communications sessions with ground control and completing one mid-course correction 
on 14 March 1966, Venera 5 approached the dark 
side of Venus on 16 May 1969 and detached its 
lander whose speed reduced from 11.17 kilome-ters/second to 210 meters/second after it hit the Venusian atmosphere at 06:02 UT. One minute 
later, controllers reestablished contact with the 
lander and began receiving data on pressure, tem-perature, and composition (sampled at least twice during descent) of the Venusian atmosphere for 
52.5 minutes. Contact was lost at an altitude of about 18 kilometers when the pressure exceeded 27 atmospheres; in other words, the probe proba
-bly cracked and became inert. Impact coordinates 
were 3° S / 18° E. Information extrapolated from Venera 5™s data suggested that ground tempera
-ture and pressure at the Venusian surface was 140 
atmospheres and 530°C, respectively.

a velocity of 11.17 kilometers/second at 06:05 UT on 17 May 1969. The Venera 6 capsule transmitted 
data for 51 minutes before contact was lost, proba-bly at an altitude of about 18 kilometers. Pressure was 27 atmospheres at loss of contact, similar to that measured by Venera 5 at a much higher alti
-tude indicating that Venera 6 may have come down 
over a mountain or high plateau. Landing coordi-nates were 5° S / 23° E. Results from the Venera 5

Results: This was the sixth attempt at a robotic cir-cumlunar flight in support of the L1 piloted lunar program and the first after the resounding success of the American Apollo 7 in December 1968. The 
Proton launch vehicle lifted off on time and first stage operation was nominal. However, during 
second stage firing, one of the four engines of the stage spuriously switched off at T+313.66 seconds, 
about 25 seconds early. The other engines contin
-ued firing (and could have actually compensated for the loss of thrust), but subsequently, the pri
-mary third stage engine also switched off early during its firing sequence, at T+500.03 seconds, due to a breakdown in the main pipeline feeding fuel to the fuel gas generator. After a near-ballistic 
flight, the L1 payload landed (and was recovered) southeast of Irkutsk near the border between the USSR and Mongolia.851969

-prised a lander stage (the ﬁKTﬂ) topped off by an eight-wheeled remote-controlled lunar rover (the ﬁ8YeLﬂ) for exploring the Moon™s surface. Essen

period of three lunar days (i.e., roughly three Earth months) and collect scientific data from various points on the lunar surface. This first attempt to put the rover on the Moon was a complete failure. At T+51.42 seconds, the payload stack disinte-grated and the booster exploded at T+54 seconds. Debris landed about 15 kilometers from the launch site. Later investigation indicated that maximum dynamic pressure during the ascent trajectory tore the new and untested payload shroud off at its weakest tension points. Despite an intensive effort, searchers were unable to find the polonium-210 radioactive isotope heat source in the rover. 
Unconfirmed rumors still abound that soldiers at the launch site used the isotope to heat their bar-racks during the bitter winter of 1968Œ1969.105

Scientific Instruments: [unknown]
Results: This was the first attempted launch of the 
giant N1 booster as part of early test operations in the Soviet piloted lunar landing program. N1 development began in 1962 after two years of ini-tial R&D on heavy booster designs. Although the 
first launch had been originally planned for 1965, a major redesign of the booster in 1964 and financial and organizational difficulties delayed the launch by four years. The Soviet Communist Party and 
government officially sanctioned the human lunar landing program in August 1964, more than three 
years after President John F. Kennedy™s famous 
speech calling on the United States to land an American on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. Development of both the N1 rocket and the L3 payload was plagued by many delays. On this first launch, the N1 carried a basic 7K-L1 space-craft modified for operations in lunar orbit (rather than for circumlunar flight). Known as the 7K-L1S, the spacecraft was equipped with an Engine Orien-tation Complex (DOK) for attitude control in lunar orbit. The plan was for the spacecraft to carry out a short mission in lunar orbit (during which time it 
would have tried to photograph the Ye-8 rover on 
86BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
the surface, the one that had failed to reach orbit just two days earlier). During the launch of the 
N1, two first stage engines (of a total of 30 NK-15 engines) shut down, but the remaining 28 engines operated for over a minute despite a growing fire at 
the base of the rocket. The rocket™s KORD control 

system effectively shut down all first state engines at T+70 seconds. The booster crashed about 50 kilometers from the launch site and the payload 
successfully used its launch escape system to 
descend without problem 32Œ35 kilometers from the pad. Investigators believed that booster failed due when a pipe for measuring fuel pressure broke 
at T+ 23.3 seconds that set in motion a sequence 
of events that led to a huge fire at T+54.5 seconds in the tail of the first stage. The fire short-circuited the control system and shut down all the engines 
at T+70 seconds.106

 Credit:˜NASA
Results: Mariner VI and VII, identical spacecraft 
intended to fly by Mars, were the first Mariner spacecraft launched by the Atlas Centaur, permit
-ting a heavier instrument suite. Both spacecraft 
were intended to study the surface and atmosphere 
of Mars during close flybys (approximately 3,200 
kilometers) that would include a radio-occultation experiment. All onboard instrumentation was 
designed to collect data on Mars; there were no 
experiments for study of interplanetary space. The 
3.35-meter tall spacecraft was built around an eight-sided magnesium framework with four rect
-angular solar panels for 449 W power. The heart 
of the spacecraft was the 11.8-kilogram Control 
Computer and Sequencer (CC&S) computer which was designed to independently operate Mariner without intervention from ground control. 
After a mid-course correction on 28 February 1969 

and preliminary imaging sessions (50 photos) on 28 July˚Mariner VI flew by Mars at 05:19:07 UT on 31 July at a distance of 3,429 kilometers. Just 
15 minutes prior to closest approach (south of the 
Martian equator), the two TV cameras on a scan 
871969
 platform began taking photos of the planet auto-matically every 42 seconds. Mariner VI took 24 near-encounter photos during a period of 17 min
-utes which were stored on a tape recorder and later transmitted back to Earth some 20 hours after the flyby at a rate of one frame every 5 minutes. The 
photos showed heavily cratered and chaotic areas not unlike parts of the Moon. Images of the south polar region showed intriguing detail of an irregular border. The scientific instruments indicated that 
the polar cap gave off infrared radiation consistent with solid carbon dioxide. Mariner VI found sur-face pressure to be equal to about 30.5 kilometers above Earth™s surface. Atmospheric composition 
was about 98% carbon dioxide. Surface tempera-tures ranged from Œ73°C at night to Œ125°C at the south polar cap. Mariner VI eventually entered heliocentric orbit (1.14 × 1.75 AU) and NASA 
continued to receive data from the vehicle until 
mid-1971.107

first of a new generation of Mars probes designed 
by the Lavochkin design bureau for launch on the 
heavy Proton booster. Although the 1969 missions 
were originally meant for both Mars orbit and land-ing, weight constraints late in mission planning 
forced engineers to delete the lander and retain 
only the orbiter. These new probes were designed 
around a single large spherical tank to which three 
pressurized compartments were attached. After two 
en route mid-course corrections during a six-month 
flight to Mars, the spacecraft were intended to 
enter orbit around Mars at roughly 1,700 × 34,000 
kilometers at 40° inclination. After an initial pho
-tography mission, the probes would lower their peri-center to about 500Œ700 kilometers for a second 
imaging mission. Total mission lifetime would be 
about three months. During the launch of the first 
M-69, the Proton™s third stage stopped firing at 
T+438.46 seconds after its turbopump had caught 
on fire because of a faulty rotor bearing. The probe, 
scheduled to reach Mars orbit on 11˜September

Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system (two TV cameras)2. infrared spectrometer3. ultraviolet spectrometer4. infrared radiometer5. celestial mechanics experiment6. S-band occultation experiment7. conical radiometerResults: Identical to Mariner VI, Mariner VII had a similar mission of flying by Mars. After Mariner VI 
had returned intriguing photos of Mars™ south polar 
cap, controllers reprogrammed Mariner VII™s con
-trol system to increase the number of scans of the south pole for the second spacecraft from 25 to 33. After a perfect mid-course correction on the way to Mars on 8 April 1969, on 30 July, just 7 hours 
before its twin was scheduled to fly by Mars, the deep space tracking station at Johannesburg, South Africa, lost contact with the spacecraft™s high-gain 
antenna. One of two stations in Madrid, Spain was diverted from their original missions of tracking Pioneer VIII and joined the search for Mariner 
VII. Fortunately, the Pioneer station at Goldstone 
picked up faint signals from the spacecraft. Con-trollers sent commands to Mariner VII to switch to the low-gain antenna that worked well after-wards. Mission controllers later speculated that the spacecraft had been thrown out of alignment when struck by a micrometeoroid (although later speculations centered on the silver-zinc battery 
on board which might have exploded, with vent-ing electrolytes acting like a thruster). As a result, 
15 telemetry channels were lost. Despite problems with positional calibration, Mariner VII recorded 93 far-encounter and 33 near-encounter images of 
the planet, showing heavily cratered terrain very similar to Mariner VI. Closest approach to Mars was at 05:00:49 UT on 5 August 1969 at a distance 
of 3,430 kilometers. Oddly, despite the high reso
-lution of 300 meters, Mariner VII found the center of Hellas to be devoid of craters. The spacecraft found a pressure of 3.5 millibars and a temperature of Œ90°F at 59° S / 28° E in the Hellespontus region, suggesting that this area was elevated about 
6 kilometers above the average terrain. Post fight 
analysis showed that at least three photos from Mariner VII included the moon Phobos. Although 
surface features were not visible, the pictures clearly showed the moon to be irregularly shaped. Mariner VII entered heliocentric orbit (1.11 × 1.70 AU) and NASA maintained continued to receive 
data from the vehicle until mid-1971.109

 reached intermediate Earth orbit. At launch, at 
T+0.02 seconds, one of the six first-stage engines of the Proton malfunctioned. Although the booster 
lifted off using the remaining five engines, it began veering off course and eventually turned with its nose toward the ground (at about 30° to the hor-izontal). At T+41 seconds, the booster impacted 
three kilometers from the launch site and exploded 
into a massive fireball. The launch complex was not affected although windows shattered in the Proton assembly building. Engineers believed that even if either or both of these M-69 Mars spacecraft had gotten off the ground, they probably had very little chance of success in their primary missions. Both the M-69 spacecraft were brought to launch in a period of immense stress and hurry for engineers 
at Lavochkin. In remembering the M-69 series,

lunar rover spacecraft developed by the Lavochkin design bureau. This particular version, whose devel-opment began in 1968, was designed to recover a small portion of soil from the lunar surface and return it to Earth. It shared the basic lander stage (ﬁKTﬂ) as the rover variant (built around a structure comprising four spherical propellant tanks linked together in a square), which was now installed with a robot arm to scoop up lunar soil. The rover was replaced by a new ﬁascent stageﬂ that was built 
around three spherical propellant tanks that con-sisted of a main rocket engine (the S5.61) to lift off from the Moon, a pressurized compartment for electronics, and a small 39-kilogram spherical cap-sule which would detach from the stage and reen-ter Earth™s atmosphere with its valuable payload 
of lunar dust. On the first launch attempt of the Ye-8-5 robot scooper, the first three stages of the 
Proton worked without fault, but the Blok D fourth stage, which was to fire to attain orbital velocity, 
failed to ignite due to a disruption in the circuit of its guidance system. The payload reentered over the Pacific Ocean without reaching Earth orbit.

Results: This was the second attempt to launch the giant N1 rocket. Like its predecessor, its payload 
consisted of a basic 7K-L1 spacecraft equipped with additional instrumentation and an attitude control block to enable operations in lunar orbit. Moments after launch, the first stage of the booster 
exploded in a massive inferno that engulfed the entire launch pad and damaged nearby buildings and structures for several kilometers around the 90BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
area. Amazingly, the payload™s launch escape system 
fired successfully at T+14.5 seconds and the 7K-L1 descent module was recovered safely two 
kilometers from the pad. An investigation commis
-sion traced the cause of the failure to the entry of a 
foreign object into the oxidizer pump of one of the first stage engines at T-0.25 seconds. The ensuing 
explosion started a fire that began to engulf the first stage. The control system shut down all engines except one by T+10.15 seconds. The booster lifted about 200 meters off the pad and then came crash-ing down in a massive explosion. Some estimates suggest that the resulting explosion had a power of about 25 tons of TNT.

Scientific Instruments:1. stereo imaging system2. remote arm for sample collection3. radiation detectorResults: Luna 15, launched only three days before the historic Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, was 
the second Soviet attempt to recover and bring lunar soil back to Earth. In a race to reach the Moon and return to Earth, the parallel missions of Luna 15 and Apollo 11 were, in some ways, the 
culmination of the Moon race that defined the 
space programs of both the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. Prior to launch, due to mass constraints, designers removed one of two 1.28-kilogram radio transmitters from the Rye-85 ascent stage, leaving only one for the entire return part of the mission. On the way to the Moon, con-trollers detected abnormally high temperatures in the propellant tanks feeding the S5.61 engine (to be used for takeoff from the Moon and return to Earth). By carefully keeping the tank in the Sun™s 
shadow, controllers were able to reduce the tem
-perature and the avoid the risk of an explosion en route. After a mid-course correction the day after 
launch, Luna 15 entered lunar orbit at 10:00 UT on 17 July 1969. Originally, plans were to carry out 
two orbital corrections, on 18 and 19 July, respec
-tively, to put the vehicle on its landing track, but the 
ruggedness of the lunar terrain prompted a delay. 
Instead, controllers spent nearly four days studying data (over 20 communication sessions) to map out a plan of action to account for the rough geogra-phy. The two delayed corrections were eventually 
carried out on 19 July (at 13:08 UT) and 20 July (at 14:16 UT), putting Luna 15 into its planned 110 × 16-kilometer orbit at a retrograde inclination of 127°. Less than 6 hours after the second cor-rection, Apollo 11 began its descent to the Moon, 
landing at 20:17 UT on 20 July. The original plan 
was for Luna 15 to embark on the Moon, less than 2 hours after Apollo 11 but it was not to be. Unsure 
of the terrain below, controllers delayed the land
-ing by another 18 hours. During this critical period, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin 
E. ﬁBuzzﬂ Aldrin walked on the Moon. Finally, at 
15:46:43 UT on 21 July, a little more than 2 hours 
prior to the Apollo 11 liftoff from the Moon, Luna 
15, now on its 52nd orbit around the Moon, began its descent to the surface. Transmissions, however, 
abruptly ceased after four minutes instead of nearly five. According to the original plan, the main engine 
was to fire for 267.3 seconds and bring the vehicle down to about 2.5 kilometers altitude. During the descent, transmissions from the vehicle abruptly and suddenly ended 237 seconds into the engine firing at 15:50:40 UT. The data seemed to show 
that the spacecraft was 3 kilometers above the 
lunar surface. Later analysis indicated that Luna 15 
911969
 had probably crashed onto the side of a mountain (at something like 480 kilometers/hour) as a result 
of incorrect attitude of the vehicle at the time of ignition of the descent engineŠin other words, the spacecraft was probably descending not directly 
towards the surface but at a slight angle. Luna 15 crashed about 15 kilometers laterally away and 45 kilometers ahead of its assumed location. Impact was roughly at 17° N / 60°˜E in Mare Crisium.113

selected for the experiment. After a mid-course

kilometers from Earth, the spacecraft successfully

a range of 1,200 kilometers. Zond 7 performed 
color imaging sessions on 8 August (of Earth) and 
11 August (two sessions of both Earth and the 
Moon). The only major malfunction during the 
mission was the non-deployment of the main par-abolic antenna (due to a problem in the securing

operations on 12 December 1970 when the lander 
probe™s batteries were charged up (using solar 
panels on the bus) and internal temperature low-ered. At 04:58:38 UT on 15 December, the lander 
separated from the bus and entered the Venusian 
atmosphere at an altitude of 135 kilometers and 
a velocity of 11.5 kilometers/second. When aero
-dynamic drag had reduced velocity down to 200 
meters/second at an altitude of 60 kilometers, 
the parachute system deployed (at 04:59:10 UT). 
The ride down was a bumpy one and it™s possible 
that the parachute tore and ultimately collapsed 
before impact, which was at a velocity of 17 
meters/second at 05:34:10 UT on the nightside of 
the Venusian landscape, about 2,000 kilometers 
from the morning terminator. Although transmis
-sions appeared to have ended at the moment of 
landing, Soviet ground tracking stations recorded 
what at first proved to be unintelligible noise. After 
computer processing of the data, Soviet scientists 
discovered a valuable 22 minutes 58 seconds of 
information from the capsuleŠthe first transmis
-sions from the surface of another planet. Quite 
likely, the initial loss-of-signal occurred when the 
capsule tipped over on its side. Venera 7™s data 
indicated a surface temperature of 475±20°C and 
a pressure of 90±15 atmospheres. The information 
was a good fit with previous Soviet and American 
estimates. Impact point was 5° S / 351° longitude 
at Tinatin Planitia.

Results: Luna 16 was a landmark success for the Soviets in their deep space exploration program, 
being the first fully automatic recovery of lunar 
samples from the surface of the Moon. The suc-cess came after five consecutive failures. After an 

uneventful coast to the Moon (which included one 
mid-course correction), Luna 16 entered a roughly circular lunar orbit at 118.6 × 102.6 kilometers 
with a 70° inclination on 17 September, using its 

11D417 propulsion unit (which consisted of a pri-
mary engine capable of 11 firings and a set of low-thrust engines). Two further orbital adjustments 
on 18 and 19 September altered both altitude and 
inclination in preparation for its descent to the 

Moon. The following day, when Luna 16 reached 
13.28 kilometers altitude, close to perilune, it fired its main engine to begin its descent to the surface, 

using the DA-018 Planeta Doppler landing radar 

in conjunction with the Vega altimeter. After firing 
for about 270 seconds and descending down to 
2.45 kilometers, Luna 16 went into freefall until 

the probe was at a height of 600 meters (falling 

at 700 meters/second) when the main engine fired again briefly, cutting off at 20 meters altitude. Two 
96BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
smaller engines then fired to reduce the landing velocity to a gentle 9 kilometers/hour. It had taken 

roughly 6 minutes from beginning of deorbit to land
-ing, which occurred at 05:18 UT on 20˜September, 

about 280 hours after launch. Coordinates were 
announced as 0°41˜ S / 56°18˜ E, in the northeast 
area of the Sea of Fertility approximately 100 kilo
-meters west of Webb crater. Mass of the spacecraft 

at landing was 1,880 kilograms. Attempts to pho
-tograph possible sampling sites proved to be less 
than successful due to poor lighting, but less than an hour after landing, at 06:03˜UT, an automatic 
drill penetrated into the lunar surface to collect a 

soil sample. After drilling for 7 minutes, the drill 

reached a stop at 35 centimeters depth and then withdrew its sample (largely dark grey loose rock or regolith) and lifted it in an arc to the top of the 
spacecraft, depositing the precious cargo in a small 
spherical capsule mounted on the main space-craft bus. (Some of the soil apparently fell out 
during this procedure). Finally, at 07:43:21 UT on 

21˜September, the spacecraft™s 512 kilogram upper 

stage lifted off from the Moon using the S5.61 

engine developed by the Isayev design bureau. This ingeniously designed single-firing engine weighed 
42 kilograms and generated 1,917 kgf thrust for 
a guaranteed 60 seconds. Three days later, after 

a direct ascent traverse with no mid-course cor
-rections, the capsule with its 101 grams of lunar 
soil reentered Earth™s atmosphere at a velocity of 

10.95 kilometers/second, experiencing up to 350 

g™s deceleration. The capsule, weighing 34 kilo
-grams, parachuted down 80 kilometers south-
east of the town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan 

at 05:26˜UT on 24 September 1970. Analysis of 

the dark basalt material indicated a close resem-blance to soil recovered by the American Apollo 

12 mission. The sample was found to be a mature 
mare regolith, with an abundance of fused soil and 
glass fragments, between 4.25 and 4.85 billion years old. The Soviets shared samples with repre-sentatives from France, the German Democratic 
Republic, and Iraq, among a number of nations. 
Based on images taken in 2009 and 2010, NASA™s 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) was able to 
more precisely identify the landing coordinates of 
Luna˜16 as 0.5134° S / 56.3638° E.121

Scientific Instruments:1.solar wind collector packages2.imaging systemResults: Zond 8 was the last in the series of circum
-lunar spacecraft designed to rehearse a piloted cir
-cumlunar flight. The project was initiated in 1965 
to compete with the Americans in the race to the 

Moon, but lost its importance once three astro
-nauts circled the Moon on the Apollo 
 mission 
in December 1968. After a m
id-course correction 
on 22 October at distance of 250,000 kilometers 

from Earth, Zond 8 reached the Moon without any 
apparent problem
s, circling its target on 24 October 
at a range of 1,110 kilometers. The spacecraft took 
black-and-white photographs of the lunar surface 
during two sepa
rate sessions. (E
arlier, it took pic
-tures of Earth during the outbound flight at a dis
-
tance of 65,000 kilometers). After two mid-course 

corrections on the return leg, Zond 8 achieved a 

return trajectory over Earth™s northern hemisphere 

instead of the sta
ndard southern approa
ch profile, 
allowing Soviet ground control sta
tions to main
-tain near-continuous contact with the craft. The 

guidance system, however, malfunctioned on the 
return leg, and the spacecra
ft performed a
 simple 
ballistic (instead of a guided) reentry into Earth™s 971970
 atmosphere. The vehicle™s descent module splashed 
down safely in the Indian Ocean at 13:55˜UT on 
27 October about 730 kilometers southeast of the Chagos Islands, 24 kilometers from its original 
target point. Soviet recovery ships were on hand to collect it and bring it back to Moscow.

6. RT-1 x-ray telescope
7. odometer/speedometerResults: Luna 17 continued the spate of successes in Soviet lunar exploration begun by Luna 16 and 
Zond 8. Luna 17 carried Lunokhod 1, the first in a series of robot lunar roving vehicles, whose concep-tion had begun in the early 1960s, originally as part 
of the piloted lunar landing operations. The under-carriage was designed and built by VNII Trans
-mash although Lavochkin retained overall design conception of the vehicle. This was the second attempt to land such a vehicle on the Moon after a failure in February 1969. The descent stage was 
equipped with two landing ramps for the ﬁascent 
stage,ﬂ i.e., the rover, to disembark on to the Moon™s 
surface. The 756-kilogram rover stood about 1.35 meters high and was 2.15 meters across. Each of 
its eight wheels could be controlled independently for two forward and two reverse speeds. Top speed 
was about 100 meters/hour, with commands issued 
by a five-man team of ﬁdriversﬂ on Earth who had to deal with a minimum 4.1 second delay (which 
included the 2.6 second roundtrip of the signal plus time to exert pressure on levers on the con-trol panel). These men were carefully selected from a pool of hundreds in a process that began as 
early as May 1968. Two crews, for two shifts, were 
selected, each comprising five men (commander, 
driver, flight-engineer, navigator, and narrow-beam 
antenna guidance operator). The commanders of these ﬁsedentary cosmonauts,ﬂ as they were called, 
were Yu. F. Vasil™yev and I. L. Fedorov, while the 
drivers were N. M. Yeremenko and V. G. Dovgan™, 
respectively. The set of scientific instruments was 
powered by solar cells (installed on the inside of the hinged top lid of the rover) and chemical bat-teries. After two mid-course corrections en route to 
the Moon, Luna 17 entered an 85 × 141- kilometer lunar orbit inclined at 141°. Repeating the same dynamic descent activities as its predecessor, Luna 
17 landed on the lunar surface at 03:46:50 UT on 17 November 1970 at 38° 24˜ N / 34° 47˜ W (as known at the time), about 2,500 kilometers from the Luna 16 site in the Sea of Rains. The lander settled in a crater-like depression 150Œ200 meters 
in diameter and 7 meters deep. As a result of Yere
-menko™s command, driver G. G. Latypov pushed a 
lever and then pressed a button to move the vehi-cle off its platform with a ﬁFirstŠForward!ﬂ excla
-mation. It was 06:27:07 UT on 17 November. It 
took 20 seconds to roll down to the surface. During its 322 Earth days of operation, the rover traveled 10.47 kilometers (later, in 2013, revised down to 
9.93 kilometers) and returned more than 20,000 TV images and 206 high resolution panoramas. In addition, Lunokhod 1 performed 25 soil analyses with its RIF-MA x-ray fluorescence spectrom
-eter and used its penetrometer at 537 different 98BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
locations over a 10.5-kilometer route (averaging 
one use every c. 20 meters). Lunokhod 1 also car-ried a 3.7-kilogram French-supplied instrument 
above the forward cameras, the TL-1, consisting 
of 14 10-centimeter silica glass prisms to bounce 
back pulses of ruby laser light fired from observa-tories in Crimea and France. Scientists first used 
this reflector on 5 and 6 December, allowing the 
EarthŒMoon distance to be measured down to an 
accuracy of 30 centimeters. However, dust appar
-ently covered the reflector and few further echoes 
were obtained. Controllers finished the last com-munications session with Lunokhod 1 at 13:05˜UT 
on 14˜September 1971. Attempts to reestablish 
contact were discontinued on 4 October, thus 
culminating one of the most successful robotic 
missions of the early space age. Lunokhod 1 
clearly outperformed its expectationsŠits planned 
design life was only 3 lunar days (about 21 Earth 
days) but it operated for 11. Many years later, in 
March 2010, a team of scientists based at several 
U.S. academic institutions resumed laser ranging 
with the laser reflector on Lunokhod 1, based on 
data from NASA™s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter 
(LRO) which allowed a precise determination (to 
5 meters accuracy) of the location of the (former) 
Soviet rover. The new data provided a more precise 
location for Lunokhod 1 as 38.333° N / 35.037°˜W. 
The landing site of Luna 17 was also refined to 
38.238° N / 34.997° W.

Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system2. ultraviolet spectrometer3. infrared spectrometer4. infrared radiometerResults: Mariner-71H (also called Mariner-H) was 
the first of a pair of American spacecraft intended 
to explore the physical and dynamic characteristics of Mars from Martian orbit. The overall goals of the series were: to search for an environment that could support life; to collect data on the origins and evolution of the planet; to gather information on planetary physics, geology, planetology, and cos
-mology; and to provide data that could aid future spacecraft such as the Viking landers. Launch of 
Mariner-71H was nominal until just after separa
-tion of the Centaur upper stage when a malfunction occurred in the stage™s flight control system leading 
to loss of pitch control at an altitude of 148 kilome-ters at T+4.7 minutes. As a result, the stack began 
to tumble and the Centaur engines shut down. The stage and its payload reentered Earth™s atmo
-sphere approximately 1,500 kilometers downrange 
from the launch site, about 400 kilometers north of Puerto Rico. The problem was traced to a failed integrated circuit in the pitch guidance˜module.124

vehicles, Soviet planners added a third mission, the M-71S, a simple orbiter that could become 
the first spacecraft to go into orbit around Mars. The orbiter could also collect data important for aiming the two landers at precise locations on the 

Martian surface. These new vehicles were the first 
Soviet robotic spacecraft to have digital computers (the S-530), which was a simplified version of the Argon-11 carried on the 7K-L1 (ﬁZondﬂ) circum-lunar spacecraft. The first of these Mars space-craft entered Earth orbit successfully (145 × 159 
kilometers at 51.5° inclination), but the Blok D upper stage failed to fire the second time to send 
the spacecraft to Mars. Later investigation showed 
that there had been human error in programming the firing time for the Blok. Apparently, the timer 
that would ignite the Blok D was incorrectly pro
-
grammed to fire after 150 hours instead of 1.5 
hours. (One report claimed that a programmer incorrectly programmed the time in years instead 
of hours). The stranded spacecraft, which was 
named Kosmos 419 by the Soviet press, reentered 
Earth™s atmosphere within two days of launch. 

The Soviets had promised the French that two of 
their Stéréo-1 instruments would be sent to Mars during the 1971 window, but since one was lost on 

Kosmos 419 which had officially nothing to do with 

a Mars mission, Soviet officials were forced to keep silent about its fate. 125

combination spacecraft sent to Mars by the Soviet Union during the 1971 launch period. The orbit-ers were roughly cylindrical structures fixed to a large propellant tank base. The landers were egg-shaped modules with petals that would open up on the Martian surface. The 1,000 kilogram landers 
(of which 355 kilograms was the actual capsule on 
the surface) were fastened to the top of the bus and protected by a braking shell for entry into the Martian atmosphere. After jettisoning the shell, 
the landers would deploy parachutes to descend to the Martian surface. Each lander also carried 4-kilogram mini-rovers called PrOP-M (for Pribor otsenki prokhodimosti-Mars, or Device to Evaluate 
MobilityŠMars), a box-shaped robot that was 
equipped with skids; the device would move by 
moving the body forward (at a speed of 1 meter/
minute) with the ski resting on the soil. The range of the device, connected by an umbilical cord to supply power and transmit data, was 15 meters. PrOP-M carried a penetrometer and a radiation densimeter. If the device ran into an obstacle, sen
-sors at the front would send a signal to an auto-mated control system on the lander, which would 
then send a command to back up PrOP-M, turn 
it ﬁrightﬂ (if the obstacle was towards the left) or ﬁleftﬂ (if the obstacle was towards the right), and 
then take one step forward again. As Mars 2 made 
its way to the Red Planet, controllers performed two successful mid-course corrections, on 17 June 
and 20 November 1971. On 27 November 1971, Mars˜2 implemented its final mid-course correc
-tion after which the lander probe separated to ini-tiate atmospheric entry. At this point, the onboard 
computer was designed to implement final correc-tions to the trajectory and spin up the lander around its longitudinal axis and then fire a solid propellant engine to initiate reentry in a specific direction. As 
it happened, after the final course correction, the trajectory of the spacecraft had been so accurate 
that there was no need for further corrective mea-sures. Because of pre-programmed algorithms that simply assumed a deviated trajectory, the lander 
was put into an incorrect attitude after separation to compensate for the ﬁerror.ﬂ When the reentry 
engine fired, the angle of entry proved to be far too steep. The parachute system never deployed and 
the lander eventually crashed onto the Martian surface at 4°˜N / 47° W. It was the first human-
made object to make contact with Mars. The Mars 2 orbiter meanwhile successfully entered orbit 
around Mars at 20:19˜UT on 27 November 1971. 
Parameters were 1,380 × 25,000 kilometers at 
48.9° inclination, with an orbital period of 1,080 minutes, slightly less than the expected 1,440 min-utes. In a clear obfuscation of the truth, the Soviets claimed that one of the two French Stéréo-1 instru
-ments was lost with the other instruments on Mars 2, when in fact, Stéréo-1 was not carried on Mars 2 but the earlier failed Kosmos 419. [See Mars 3 for Mars 2 orbiter˜program.]126

At 09:14 UT on 2 December 1971, the lander sep-arated from the orbiter and 4.5 hours later began entry into the Martian atmosphere. Finally, at 
13:47 UT, the probe successfully set down intact 
on the Martian surface becoming the first human-made object to perform a survivable landing on the planet. Landing coordinates were 44.90° S˜/ 
160.08° W. The bus meanwhile entered orbit 
around Mars with parameters of 1,530 × 214,500 kilometers at 60.0° inclination, significantly more eccentric than originally plannedŠat least 11 times higher than nominal. Immediately after landing, at 13:50:35 UT, the lander probe began transmitting 
a TV image of the Martian surface although trans-missions abruptly ceased after 14.5 seconds (or 20 seconds according to some sources). Because of 
a violent dust storm that raged across the planet, controllers surmised that coronal discharge may 
have shorted all electric instrumentation on the 
lander. The received image showed only a gray 
background with no detail, probably because the two imaging ﬁheadsﬂ had still not deployed in 20 seconds to their full height to see the surface. After 
the initial contact, the ground lost all contact with the lander probe. The Mars 3 orbiter, like the Mars 
2 orbiter, had problems with its imaging mission. 
Because the orbiters had to perform their imaging mission soon after entering orbitŠmainly because the chemicals on board for developing film had a finite lifetimeŠthey could not wait until the dust storms subsided on the surface. As a result, the 
photographs from both orbiters showed few details of the surface. On 23 January 1972, Pravda noted that ﬁthe dust storm is still making photography and scientific measurement of the planet diffi-cultﬂ but added on 19 February that ﬁinformation 
obtained [more recently] shows that the dust storm has ended.ﬂ Later analysis showed that the dust storm began during the first 10 days of October 
and lasted three months although the atmosphere contained residual dust until late January. Addition
-ally, controllers had set the cameras at the wrong 
exposure setting, making the photos far too light to show much detail. Despite the failure of the imag-ing mission, both orbiters carried out a full cycle of scientific experiments returning data on prop
-erties of the surface and atmosphereŠincluding on the nature and dynamics of the dust storm and water content in the Martian atmosphereŠuntil contact was lost almost simultaneously, accord
-ing to Lavochkin, in July 1972. TASS announced 
completion of both orbital missions on 23 August 
1972. The French Stéréo-1 instrument on Mars 
3 operated successfully for 185 hours over nearly seven months returning a megabyte of data on solar 103
1971
 radiation. In April 2013, NASA announced that its 
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) may have 
imaged hardware from Mars 3, including its para
-chute, heat shield, braking engine, and the lander itself. These were found in 2008 by a community of Russian space enthusiasts who were following the mission of Curiosity.

Mariner 9
Nation: USA (49)
Objective(s): Mars orbit
Spacecraft: Mariner-71I / Mariner-I
Spacecraft Mass: 997.9 kg
Mission Design and Management: NASA / JPL
Launch Vehicle:
 Atlas Centaur (AC-23 / Atlas 3C 
no. 5404C / Centaur D-1A)
Launch Date and Time:
 30 May 1971 / 22:23:04 UT
Launch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 36B
Scientific Instruments:1. imaging system2. ultraviolet spectrometer3. infrared spectrometer4. infrared radiometerResults: Mariner 9 was the second in the pair of iden-tical spacecraft launched in 1971 to orbit Mars. The 
first spacecraft, Mariner 8, failed to reach Earth 
orbit. Based on a wide octagonal structure, these 
vehicles used a bi-propellant propulsion system 
with a fixed thrust of 136 kgf for orbital insertion 
around Mars. All scientific instrumentation on the 
spacecraft were mounted on a movable scan plat-form ﬁunderneathﬂ the main bodies. The span of 
the spacecraft over its extended solar panels was 
6.9 meters. After an en route mid-course correc
-tion on 5 June 1971, at 00:18 UT on 14 November 
1971, Mariner 9 ignited its main engine for 915.6 
seconds to become the first human-made object to 
enter orbit around a planet. Initial orbital parame-ters were 1,398 × 17,916 kilometers at 64.3° incli-nation. (Another firing on the fourth revolution 
around Mars refined the orbit to 1,394 × 17,144 
kilometers at 64.34° inclination). The primary goal 
of the mission was to map about 70% of the surface 
during the first three months of operation. The ded-icated imaging mission began in late November, but 
because of the major dust storm at the planet during 
this time, photos of the planet taken prior to about 
mid-January 1972 did not show great detail. Once 
the dust storm had subsided, from 2 January 1972 
on, Mariner 9 began to return spectacular photos 
of the deeply pitted Martian landscape, for the first 
time showing such features as the great system of 
parallel rilles stretching more than 1,700 kilometers 
across Mare Sirenum. The vast amount of incoming 
data countered the notion that Mars was geologi-cally inert. There was some speculation on the pos-sibility of water having existed on the surface during 
an earlier period, but the spacecraft data could not 
provide any conclusive proof. By February 1972, the 
spacecraft had identified about 20 volcanoes, one 
of which, later named Olympus Mons, dwarfed 
any similar feature on Earth. Based on data from 
Mariner 9™s spectrometers, it was determined that 
Olympus Mons, part of Nix OlympicaŠa ﬁgreat vol-canic pileﬂ possibly formed by the eruption of hot 
magma from the planet™s interiorŠis about 15Œ30 
kilometers tall and has a base with a diameter of 600 
kilometers. Another major surface feature identified 
was Valles Marineris, a system of canyons east of the 
Tharsis region that is more than 4,000 kilometers 
long, 200 kilometers wide, and in some areas, up 
to 7 kilometers deep. On 11 February 1972, NASA 
announced that Mariner 9 had achieved all its goals 
although the spacecraft continued sending back 
useful data well into the summer. By the time of 
last contact at 22:32 UT on 27 October 1972 when 
it exhausted gaseous nitrogen for attitude control, 
the spacecraft had mapped 85% of the planet at a 
resolution of 1Œ2 kilometers, returning 7,329 photos 
(including at least 80 of Phobos and Deimos). Thus 
ended one of the great early robotic missions of the 
space age and undoubtedly one of the most influ-ential. The spacecraft is expected to crash onto the 
Martian surface sometime around 2020.104

Apollo 15 crewŠDavid R. Scott, Alfred M. Worden, 

and James B. IrwinŠshortly before leaving lunar 
orbit. The probe was designed around a hexagonal 
structure with a diameter of 35.6 centimeters that 
was equipped with three instrument booms. Power 

supply came from solar panels and chemical bat-teries. The instruments measured the strength and 
direction of interplanetary and terrestrial magnetic 
fields, detected variations in the lunar gravity field, 

and measured proton and electron flux. The satel-lite confirmed Explorer XXXV™s finding that while 
Earth™s magnetic field deflects the incoming solar 
wind into a tail, the Moon acts as a physical barrier 

due to its weak field and creates a ﬁholeﬂ in the wind. 

An electronic failure on 3 February 1972 formally 
ended the mission. Although it originally had a one-
year design life, all mission objectives were˜fulfilled.129

Scientific Instruments:1. stereo imaging system2. remote arm for sample collection3. radiation detector4. radio altimeterResults: This was the seventh Soviet attempt to recover soil samples from the surface of the Moon and the first after the success of Luna 16. After two 
mid-course corrections on 4 and 6 September 1971, Luna 18 entered a circular orbit around the Moon on 7 September˚at 100 kilometers altitude with an inclination of 35°, an orbit that was off-nominal since the orbit insertion engine cut off 15 seconds earlier than planned. To save propellant, mission 
planners decided to conduct one (instead of two) orbital corrections to bring the spacecraft into the proper orbit for descent. This firing, held outside direct radio contact, was also not nominal, leav-ing the vehicle in a 93.4 × 180.3-kilometer orbit (instead of 16.9 × 123.9 kilometers). Telemetry 
data showed that the pitch program was two orders less than expected due to the low effectiveness of 
one of the orientation engines, which was working only on fuel and not oxidizer. After a subsequent 
orbital correction, on 11 September, the vehicle 
began its descent to the lunar surface. However, 
due to its off-nominal orbit, the same orientation engine completely failed on all three axes (pitch, yaw, roll). As a result, the roll angle was 10° less 
than the computed value (since the other orienta
-tion engines were not able to fully compensate). Contact with the spacecraft was abruptly lost at 07:47:16.5 UT at the previously determined point of lunar landing. Impact coordinates were 3° 34˜˜N˜/ 56° 30
˜ E near the edge of the Sea of Fertility. Officially, the Soviets announced that ﬁthe 
lunar landing in the complex mountainous con-ditions proved to be unfavorable.ﬂ Later, in 1975, 
the Soviets published data from Luna 18™s contin
-uous-wave radio altimeter which determined the mean density of the lunar topsoil.130

Scientific Instruments:1. 2 TV cameras2. gamma-ray spectrometer (ARL)3. RV-2NLS radiation detector
4. SIM-RMCh meteoroid detector5. SG-59M magnetometer6. radio altimeterResults: Luna 19 was the first ﬁadvancedﬂ lunar orbiter whose design was based upon the same Ye-8-
class bus used for the lunar rovers and the sample collectors. For these orbiters, designated Ye-8LS, 
the basic ﬁlander stageﬂ was topped off by a wheel-less Lunokhod-like frame that housed all scientific 
instrumentation in a pressurized container. Luna 
19 entered orbit around the Moon on 2 October 
1972 with parameters of 141.2 × 133.9 kilometers at 40.5° inclination. After two mid-course correc
-tions on 29 September and 1 October, a final cor
-rection on 6 October was to put the spacecraft into proper altitude to begin its imaging mission. How-ever, a failure in a gyro-platform in the orientation 
system pointed the vehicle incorrectly and Luna 19 ended up in a much higher orbit than planned. As a 
result, the original high-resolution imaging mission as well as use of the radio altimeter was canceled. 
Instead, the mission was reoriented to provide panoramic images of the mountainous areas of the Moon between 30° and 60° S latitude and between 106
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
20° and 80° E longitude. Because the vehicle was in a contingency spin-stabilized mode, the images unfortunately came out blurred (41 pictures were returned). In an article in Pravda on 17 February 
1973, Lavochkin Chief Designer Sergey Kryukov (1918Œ2005) noted that ﬁprominence in the scien-tific mission of the Luna 19 station was given to the study of the gravitational field of the Moonﬂ and the location of mascons. Occultation experi-ments in May and June 1972 allowed scientists to determine the concentration of charged particles 
at an altitude of 10 kilometers. Additional studies 
of the solar wind were coordinated with those per
-formed by the Mars 2 and 3 orbiters and Veneras 
7 and 8. The gamma-ray spectrometer apparently failed to provide any data. Communications with Luna 19 was lost on 1 November 1972 after 13 months of continuous operation (over 4,000 orbits of the Moon), far exceeding the planned lifetime of three˜months.107

Scientific Instruments:1. stereo imaging system2. remote arm for sample collection3. radiation detector4. radio altimeterResults: This, the eighth Soviet spacecraft launched to return lunar soil to Earth, was sent to complete 
the mission that Luna 18 had failed to accomplish. After a four-and-a-half day flight to the Moon 
that included a single mid-course correction on 15˜February, Luna 20 entered orbit around the 
Moon on February 18. Initial orbital parameters 
were 100 × 100 kilometers at 65° inclination. Three days later at 19:13 UT, the spacecraft fired 
its main engine for 267 seconds to begin descent to the lunar surface. A second firing at an altitude 
of 760 meters further reduced velocity before Luna 20 set down safely on the Moon at 19:19:09 UT on 21 February 1972 at coordinates 3° 32
˜ N / 56° 33˜ E (as announced at the time), only 1.8 kilo-meters from the crash site of Luna 18, in a high-land region between Mare Fecunditatis and Mare 
Crisium. The spacecraft settled on a slope of about 
8° to 10°. After landing, the imaging system was 
used to locate a scientifically promising location to collect a sample, which was done on 23 February, 
but in stages due to increased soil resistance. After 
the sample was safely collected, the spacecraft™s 
ascent stage lifted off at 22:58 UT on 22 February 
and quickly accelerated to 2.7 kilometers/second velocity, sufficient to return to Earth. The small 
spherical capsule parachuted down safely on an island in the Karkingir river, 40 kilometers north
-west of the town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan at 19:12 UT on 25˜February 1972. The 55-gram soil 
sample differed from that collected by Luna 16 in that the majority (50Œ60%) of the rock particles in the newer sample were ancient anorthosite (which consist largely of feldspar) rather than the basalt of the earlier one (which contained about 1Œ2% of anorthosite). They were, in fact, quite similar to samples collected by the Apollo 16 astronauts 
in April 1972. Like the Luna 16 soil, samples of 
the Luna 20 collection were exchanged with NASA officials who delivered a sample from the Apollo 15 mission, the exchange taking place on 13 April 1972. Samples were also shared with sci
-entists from France, Czechoslovakia, Great Britain 
(both Luna 16 and 20), and India. Also, as with 
Luna 16, in 2009 and 2010, images from NASA™s 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) were used 
to more precisely identify Luna 20™s landing site as 
3.7866°˜N / 56.6242° E.108

 unmatched by any other robotic spacecraft in the 
space era: the first vehicle placed on a trajectory to escape the solar system into interstellar space; 
the first spacecraft to fly beyond Mars; the first to fly through the asteroid belt; the first to fly past Jupiter; and the first to use all-nuclear electrical power (two SNAP-19 radioisotope thermal gener-ators [RTGs] capable of delivering about 140 W during the Jupiter encounter). After launch by a 
three-stage version of the Atlas Centaur (with a 
TE-M-364-4 solid propellant engine modified from the Surveyor lander), Pioneer 10 reached a max-imum escape velocity of 51,682 kilometers/hour, 
faster than any previous human-made object at that point in time. Controllers carried out two course corrections, on 7 March and 26 March, the latter to ensure an occultation experiment with Jupiter™s 
moon Io. There were some initial problems during 
the outbound voyage when direct sunlight caused heating problems, but nothing to endanger the mission. On 15 July 1972, the spacecraft entered the asteroid belt, emerging in February 1973 
after a 435 million-kilometer voyage. During this period, the spacecraft encountered some asteroid 
hits (although much less than expected) and also measured the intensity of Zodiacal light in inter-planetary space. In conjunction with Pioneer IX (in solar orbit), on 7 August, Pioneer 10 recorded 
details of one of the most violent solar storms in recent record. At 20:30 UT on 26 November, the 
spacecraft reported a decrease in the solar wind 
from 420 to 250 kilometers/second and a 100-fold 
increase in temperature, indicating that it was pass
-ing through the front of Jupiter™s bow shock where 
the solar wind clashed with the planet™s magne
-tosphere. In other words, it had entered Jupiter™s 
magnetosphere. By 1 December, Pioneer 10 was 
returning better images of the planet than possi-ble from Earth. (It had already begun imaging as early as 6 November 1973). Command-and-return 
time was up to 92 minutes by this time. Pioneer 10™s closest approach to Jupiter was at 02:26 UT on 
4˜December 1973 when the spacecraft raced by the 
planet at a range of 130,354 kilometers at a velocity of approximately 126,000 kilometers/hour. Of the 
spacecraft™s 11 scientific instruments, 6 operated 
continuously through the encounter. The space
-craft passed by a series of Jovian moons, obtaining photos of Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa (but not of Io, as the photopolarimeter succumbed to radia-tion by that time). Approximately 78 minutes after 
the closest approach, Pioneer 10 passed behind 
Jupiter™s limb for a radio occultation experiment. In 
addition, the infrared radiometer provided further information on the planet™s atmosphere. Between 
6 November and 31 December, the vehicle took 
about 500 pictures of Jupiter™s atmosphere with a 
highest resolution of 320 kilometers, clearly show-ing such landmarks as the Great Red Spot. The encounter itself was declared over on 2 January 1974. Pioneer 10 fulfilled all objectives except one due to false commands triggered by Jupiter™s 
intense radiation. Based on incoming data, scien-tists identified plasma in Jupiter™s magnetic field. 
The spacecraft crossed Saturn™s orbit in February 
1976, recording data that indicated that Jupiter™s 
enormous magnetic tail, almost 800 million kilo-meters long, covered the whole distance between the two planets. Still operating nominally, Pioneer 
10 crossed the orbit of Neptune (then the outer-most planet) on 13 June 1983, thus becoming the first human-made object to go beyond the furthest planet. NASA maintained routine contact with Pioneer 10 for over two decades until 19:35 UT on 31 March 1997 (when the spacecraft was 67 AU 
from Earth) when routine contact was terminated due to budgetary reasons. Intermittent contact, however, continued, but only as permitted by the 
onboard power source, with data collections from the Geiger tube telescope and the charged parti-cle instrument. Until 17 February 1998, Pioneer 
10 was the farthest human-made object in exis
-tence (69.4 AU) when it was passed by Voyager 1. 
A NASA ground team received a signal on the state of spacecraft systems (still nominal) on 5 August 
2000. The spacecraft returned its last telemetry 
data on 27 April 2002 and less than a year later, on 
23 January 2003, it sent its last signal back to Earth 
110
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
when it was 12.23 billion kilometers from Earth. 
That signal took 11 hours and 20 minutes to reach 
Earth. By that time, it was clear that the space
-craft™s RTG power source had decayed, thus deliv
-ering insufficient power to the radio transmitter. 
A final attempt to contact Pioneer 10 on 4 March 2006 failed. Originally designed for a 21-month mission, the mission™s lifetime far exceeded expec
-tations. By 5 November 2017, the inert Pioneer 10 spacecraft was roughly 118.824 AUs (or 17.776 
billion kilometers) from Earth, a range second only to Voyager 1. The spacecraft is generally heading in 
the direction of the red star Aldebaran which forms 
the eye of the Taurus constellation. It is expected 
to pass by Aldebaran in about two million years. 
Pioneer 10 is heading out of the solar system in a direction very different from the two Voyager 
probes and Pioneer 11, i.e., towards the nose of the heliosphere in an upstream direction relative to the inflowing interstellar gas. In case of an intercept by intelligent life, Pioneer 10 carries an aluminum plaque with diagrams of a man and a woman, the solar system, and its location relative to 14 pulsars. The expectation is that such intelligent life would 
be able to interpret the diagram to determine the position of the Sun (and thus, Earth) at the time of launch relative to the Pulsars.133

5. DOU-1M accelerometer6. radar altimeterResults: Venera 8 was the first in new pair of 
Soviet spacecraft designed to explore Venus. 
Although similar in design to its predecessors, the 
495-kilogram lander was substantially modified, 
based on the results from Venera 7. Lavochkin 
Chief Designer Sergey Kryukov noted in an inter
-view in Pravda on 5 August 1972 that ﬁVenera 8 
was a logical continuation of the previous Venera-
7ﬂ but ﬁthe construction of the descent vehicle 
was almost completely new.ﬂ The new capsule 
was designed to withstand pressures of ﬁonlyﬂ 105 
atmospheres (versus 150 atmospheres on Venera 
7) and 493°C (instead of 540°C), had an upgraded 
parachute system, and carried extra scientific 
instrumentation. After one mid-course correction 
on 6 April 1972, Venera 8™s lander separated from 
the flyby bus at 07:40 UT on 22 July 1972 and 
entered the Venusian atmosphere 57 minutes later 
at a velocity of 11.6 kilometers/second. During 
the aerodynamic breaking segment, the descent 
module reduced its velocity from 11.6 kilometers/second to 250 meters/second, thus surviving a max
-imum g-force of 335; the gas temperature in the 
shock wave at the ﬁfrontﬂ of the vehicle was more 
than 12,000°C. Successful landing took place at 
09:29˜UT about 500 kilometers from the morn
-ing terminator on the sunlit side of Venus, the first 
such landing. Landing coordinates were a 10-mile 
radius of 10.7° S / 335.25° E. The probe transmit
-ted data for another 50 minutes, 11 seconds from 
the hostile surface before succumbing to ground 
conditions. The transmitted information indi-cated that temperature and pressure at the land-ing site were 470±8°C and 90±1.5 atmospheres 
1111972
 respectively, very close to values obtained on the 
planet™s night side by Venera 7. Wind velocity was 
less than 1 kilometer/second below 10 kilometers 
altitude. Data from the gamma-ray spectrometer 
made it possible to make some determination of 
naturally occurring radioactive elements in the 
soil. Preliminary data suggested that the sur
-face material contained 4% potassium, 0.002% 
uranium, and 0.00065% thorium. The lander 
answered one of the key questions about the sur-face of Venus, namely the degree of illumination 
on the ground. Based on data from the photom-eter, scientists concluded that ﬁa certain portion 
of solar rays in the visible region of the spectrum 
penetrates to the surface of the planet and that 
there are significant differences in illumination 
between day and night.ﬂ The data indicated that 
visibility on the ground was about one kilometer 
at the time Venera 8 landed. The spacecraft also 
recorded a sharp change in illumination between 
30 and 35 kilometers altitude.

entered an elliptical orbit around Earth. Officially,

Results: This was fourth test launch of the giant Soviet N1 booster. The first two, launched in 1969, 
had attempted to send rigged up 7K-L1 spacecraft to lunar orbit. The third booster, launched in June 
1971, had carried a payload mockup for tests in Earth orbit. All three had failed. This fourth launch 
was intended to send a fully equipped 7K-LOK spacecraft (similar to a beefed-up Soyuz) on a robotic lunar orbiting mission during which the spacecraft would spend 3.7 days circling the Moon (over 42 orbits) taking photographs of future land
-ing sites for piloted missions. The booster lifted off without problems, but a few seconds prior to first stage cutoff, at T+107 seconds, a powerful explosion ripped apart the bottom of the first stage, 
destroying unequivocally Soviet hopes of sending 
cosmonauts to the Moon. There was never a con
-clusive reason for the failure, with some suggesting 
that there had been an engine failure and others convinced that the scheduled shutdown of six cen-tral engines just prior to the explosion had caused a structural shockwave that eventually caused the˜explosion.113

less than a month after the last Apollo lunar land
-ing, Luna 21 entered orbit around the Moon on 12˜January 1973 (after a single mid-course correc
-tion en route). Parameters were 110 × 90 kilometers 
at 60° inclination. On 15 January, the spacecraft 
deorbited, and after multiple engine firings, landed on the Moon at 22:35 UT the same day inside the 
55-kilometer wide LeMonnier crater at 25° 51
˜˜N˜/ 
30° 27˜ E (as announced at the time) between Mare Serenitatis and the Taurus Mountains, about 
180 kilometers north of the Apollo 17 landing site. 
Less than 3 hours later, at 01:14˜UT on 16 January, 
the rover disembarked onto the lunar surface. The 840 kilogram Lunokhod 2 was an improved ver-sion of its predecessor, and was equipped with two 
types of television cameras. The first consisted of two vidicon cameras (ﬁsmall frame televisionﬂ cameras according to the Soviet media) for trans-mitting information to help basic navigation con-trol. A second set consisted of four pair-mounted, 
side-carried panoramic opto-mechanical cyclora-mic cameras. The rover also included an improved 8-wheel traction system and additional scientific 
instrumentation, including significantly, a magne
-tometer. By the end of its first lunar day, 23 January 
1973, Lunokhod 2 had already traveled further than Lunokhod 1 in its entire operational life. The main focus of investigations during the second lunar day, which ended on 22 February, was a study 
of the transitional mare highlands in the southern part of the LeMonnier Crater, including stereo
-scopic panoramic television imagery of the surface, measurement of the lunar soil™s chemical proper
-ties, and taking magnetic readings. By this time, the rover had travelled a total of 11.067 kilometers. For the ground ﬁcrewﬂ navigating Lunokhod, there 
were times of high stress, compounded by the time lag between Earth and Moon. Izvestiya reported on 13 March 1973 that at times ﬁcrewﬂ members pulses reached 130Œ135 beats per minute with one individual holding their breath in nervousness 
for 15Œ20 seconds. During the fourth lunar day, 
which began on 9 April, Lunokhod 2 traveled right 
to the edge of a large tectonic fault in the eastern area of the littoral zone of the LeMonnier Crater, 
an area that was very difficult to traverse given 114
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
the proliferation of rocks up to 2Œ3 meters in size. By the end of the fourth lunar day on 23 April it 
had travelled 36.2 kilometers. On 9 May the rover was commanded to leave the area of the fault but inadvertently rolled into a crater, with dust cover
-ing its solar panels, disrupting temperatures in the vehicle. Attempts to save the rover failed, and on 
3 June the Soviet news agency announced that its mission was over. An official internal Soviet report 
on Lunokhod 2 noted that the rover had ﬁended its operationsﬂ earlier, at 12:25 UT on 10 May 1973, 
after temperatures had reached up to 43Œ47°C and on board systems had shut down. All subsequent 
attempts at contact apparently failed. Before last contact, the rover took 80,000 TV pictures and 86 
panoramic photos and had performed hundreds of 
mechanical and chemical surveys of the soil, includ-ing 25 soil analyses with the RIF-MA (Rentgenskiy 
izotopnyy fluorestsentnyy metod analyiza
 or x-ray Isotopic Fluorescence Analysis Method) instru
-ment. Despite the formal end of the mission, experiments with the French TL-2 laser reflector 
continued for decades, and were much more suc-cessful than the rangings carried out with the sim-ilar instrument on Lunokhod 1. At the time of the 
Lunokhod 2 mission, scientists calculated a total travel distance of 37.5 kilometers, about three-and-a-half times more than its predecessor. An extended 
summary of the scientific results from the mission was published in Pravda on 20 November 1973. The Soviets later revealed that during a conference on planetary exploration in Moscow held from 29 January to 2 February 1973 (i.e., after the land
-ing of Luna 21), an American scientist had given 
photos of the lunar surface around the Luna 21 landing site to a Soviet engineer in charge of the 
Lunokhod 2 mission. These photos, taken prior to the Apollo 17 landing, were later used by the 
ﬁdriver teamﬂ to navigate the new rover on its mis
-sion on the Moon. Later, in 2013, based on imagery 
from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), Russian researchers led by Irina Karachevtseva at the Moscow State University™s Institute of Geodesy 
and Cartography (MIIGAiK), recalculated the total distance travelled and came to a more precise 
number of between 42.1 and 42.2 kilometers. The original landing site location was also sharpened to 25.99° N / 30.41° E.138

none of these jeopardized the mission. Pioneer 11 passed through the asteroid belt without damage 
by mid-March 1974. Soon, on 26˜April 1974, it 
performed a mid-course correction (after an earlier 
one on 11 April 1973) to guide it much closer to 

Jupiter than Pioneer 10 and ensure a polar flyby. 

Pioneer 11 penetrated the Jovian bow shock on 25 November 1974 at 03:39 UT. The spacecraft™s 
closest approach to Jupiter occurred at 05:22 UT 
on 3 December 1974 at a range of 42,500 kilo-meters from the planet™s cloud tops, three times 
closer than Pioneer 10. By this time, it was trav-elling faster than any human-made object at the time, 171,000 kilometers/hour. Because of its high 

speed during the encounter, the spacecraft™s expo
-sure to Jupiter™s radiation belts spanned a shorter 

time than its predecessor although it was actually 

closer to the planet. Pioneer 11 repeatedly crossed 
Jupiter™s bow shock, indicating that the Jovian mag
-netosphere changes its boundaries as it is buffeted by the solar wind. Besides the many images of the planet (and better pictures of the Great Red 
Spot), Pioneer 11 took about 200 images of the moons of Jupiter. The vehicle then used Jupiter™s 
massive gravitational field to swing back across 
the solar system to set it on a course to Saturn. 
After its Jupiter encounter, on 16 April 1975, the 
micrometeoroid detector was turned off since it was issuing spurious commands which were inter-fering with other instruments. Mid-course correc-tions on 26 May 1976 and 13˜July 1978 sharpened 
its trajectory towards Saturn. Pioneer 11 detected Saturn™s bow shock on 31 August 1979, about a 

million-and-a-half kilometers out from the planet, 
thus providing the first conclusive evidence of the existence of Saturn™s magnetic field. The space
-craft crossed the planet™s ring plane beyond the 
outer ring at 14:36 UT on 1 September 1979 
and then passed by the planet at 16:31 UT for a close encounter at 20,900-kilometer range. It was 116
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
moving at a relative velocity of 114,100 kilometers/hour at the point of closest approach. During the encounter, the spacecraft took 440 images of the 
planetary system, with about 20 at a resolution of 
90 kilometers. Those of Saturn™s moon Titan (at 
a resolution of 180 kilometers) showed a feature-less orange fuzzy satellite. A brief burst of data on 
Titan indicated that the average global temperature 
of Titan was Œ193°C. Among Pioneer 11™s many 
discoveries were a narrow ring outside the A ring 
named the ﬁFﬂ ring and a new satellite 200 kilo-meters in diameter. The spacecraft recorded the 
planet™s overall temperature at Œ180°C and pho
-tographs indicated a more featureless atmosphere than that of Jupiter. Analysis of data suggested that 
the planet was primarily made of liquid hydrogen. After leaving Saturn, Pioneer 11 headed out of the solar system in a direction opposite to that of Pioneer 10, i.e., to the center of galaxy in the gen-eral direction of Sagittarius. Pioneer 11 crossed the orbit of Neptune on 23 February 1990 becoming 
the fourth spacecraft (after Pioneer 10, Voyager 
1 and 2) to do so. Scientists expected that during their outbound journeys, both Pioneer 10 and 11 would find the boundary of the heliosphere where 
the solar wind slows down and forms a ﬁtermi-nation shock,ﬂ beyond which there would be the 
heliopause and finally the bow shock of the inter
-stellar medium, i.e., space beyond the solar system. By 1995, 22 years after launch, two instruments were still operational on the vehicle. NASA Ames 
Research Center made last contact with the space-craft on 30 September 1995 when Pioneer 11 was 
44.1 AU from Earth. Scientists later received a few 
minutes of good engineering data on 24 November 
1995 but lost contact again once Earth moved out of view of the spacecraft™s antenna. Like Pioneer 
10, Pioneer 11 also carries a plaque with a message for any intelligent beings. By 5 November 2017, it was estimated to be about 97.590 AU (or 14.599 
billion kilometers) from˜Earth.139

 the planets, and other galactic and extra-galactic sources, while in a circular orbit around the Moon. 
Its location was driven by the need to avoid ter-restrial radio interference. After launch on a direct 

ascent trajectory to the Moon and one mid-course 
correction on 11 June, Explorer 49 fired its inser-tion motor on 07:21 UT on 15 June to enter orbit around the Moon. Initial orbital parameters were 1,334 × 1,123 kilometers at 61.3° inclination. On 
18 June the spacecraft jettisoned its main engine 
and, using its Velocity Control Propulsion System, 
circularized its orbit to 1,063 × 1,052 kilometers at 38.7° inclination. The spacecraft was the larg
-
est human-made object to orbit the Moon with its 
deployed antennas measuring 457.2 meters (nearly half a kilometer!) tip-to-tip. These antennas, as well as a 192-meter long damper boom and a 
36.6-meter dipole antenna were all stored away on 
motor-driven reels which allowed them to unfurl 
in lunar orbit. Once in lunar orbit, the spacecraft 
deployed its various antennae in stages, assuming 
its full form by November 1974. During its mis-sion, Explorer 49 studied low-frequency radio 

emissions from the solar system (including the Sun and Jupiter) and other galactic and extra-galactic 
sources. NASA announced completion of the mis-sion in June 1975 although contact was maintained 
until August 1977.

BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Results: Mars 4 was one of four Soviet spacecraft of 
the 3MS (or M-73) series launched in 1973. Soviet planners were eager to preempt the American 
Viking missions planned for 1976 but were limited 
by the less advantageous positions of the planets which allowed the Proton-K/Blok D boosters to launch only limited payloads towards Mars. The 
Soviets thus separated the standard pair of orbit-er-lander payload combinations into two orbiters 
and two landers. Less than four months prior to 
launch, ground testing detected a major prob
-lem with the 2T312 transistors (developed by the Pulsar Scientific-Research Institute) used on all four vehicles, apparently because the factory that manufactured it used aluminum contacts instead of gold-plated contacts. An analysis showed that 
the transistors™ failure rate began to increase after 
1.5 to 2 years operation, i.e., just about when the spacecraft would reach Mars. Despite the roughly 50% odds of success, the government decided to proceed with the missions. The first spacecraft, Mars 4, successfully left Earth orbit and headed towards Mars and accomplished a single mid-course correction on 30 July 1973, but soon two of three channels of the onboard computer failed due to the faulty transistors. As a result, the second 
mid-course correction by its main 11D425A 
engine could not be implemented. With no possi
-bility for Mars orbit insertion, Mars 4 flew by the Red Planet at 15:34 UT on 10 February 1974 at a 
range of 1,844 kilometers. Ground control was able to command the vehicle to turn on its TV imaging system (Vega-3MSA) 2 minutes prior to this point 
(at 15:32:41) to begin a short photography session 
of the Martian surface during the flyby. (The other 
TV camera system known as Zufar-2SA was never 
turned on due to a failure). The TV camera took 12 standard images from ranges of 1,900 to 2,100 kilometers distance over a period of 6 minutes. The other OMS scanner also provided two panoramas of the surface. The spacecraft eventually entered 
heliocentric orbit.141

After two mid-course corrections on 3 August 1973

main engine at 15:44:25 UT to enter orbit around 
the planet. Initial orbital parameters were 1,760 × 
32,586 kilometers at 35° 19˜ 17˛ inclination. Soon 
after orbital insertion, ground controllers detected 
the slow depressurization of the main instrument 
compartment on the orbiter, probably as a result of 
an impact with a particle during or after orbital inser-tion. Calculations showed that at the current rate 
119
1973
 of air loss, the spacecraft would be operational for 
approximately three more weeks. Scientists drew up 

a special accelerated science program that included 
imaging of the surface at 100-meter resolution. Five 
imaging sessions on 17, 21, 23, 25 and 26 February 

1974 produced a total of 108 frames of comprising 

only 43 usable photographs. Both the high-resolution 
Vega-3MSA and the survey Zufar-2SA TV cameras 
were used. Additionally, Mars 5 used the OMS scan
-ner to take five panoramas of the surface. The last 

communication with Mars 5, when the final pan-orama was transmitted back to Earth, took place on 
28 February 1974, after which pressure in the space
-craft reduced below working levels. Mars 5™s photos, 

some of which were of comparable quality to those 
of Mariner 9, clearly showed surface features which 
indicated erosion caused by free-flowing water. The 

first of these images taken by both the television 

cameras were published in the Academy of Sciences™ 
journal in the fall of 1974. Among significant achieve
-ments claimed for Mars 5 was ﬁreceipt of mean data 
on the chemical composition of rocks on Mars for the 

first time.ﬂ The vehicle was supposed to act as a data 

relay for the Mars 6 and Mars 7 landers which arrived

BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Results: Mars 6 was one of two combination fly-by-lander launched by the Soviet Union during the 1973 launch period. The landers were very similar in design to the Mars 2 and Mars 3 landers dis-patched by the Soviets in 1971, except the space-craft was now comprised of a flyby vehicle (instead of an orbiter) and a 1,000-kilogram lander. Mars 6 
completed its first mid-course correction en route to Mars at 23:45 UT on 12 August 1973, but imme
-diately a tape recorder on board failed, forcing con-trollers to use a backup. Then on 3˜September, 
there was a major failure in the telemetry system that transmitted scientific and operations data from the spacecraft. Only two channels remained 
operational, neither of which provided the ground with any direct data on the status of the flyby vehicle™s systems. Controllers could only use a 
time-consuming ﬁplaybackﬂ mode for the reception of data. Ultimately, the flyby spacecraft automat
-ically performed all its functions and at 05:01:56 UT (signal reception time) on 12 March 1974, the lander successfully separated from its mother ship at a distance of 46,000 kilometers from Mars. 
About 4 hours later, at 09:05:53 UT, it entered the 
Martian atmosphere at a velocity of 5,600 meters/second. The parachute system deployed correctly at an altitude of 20 kilometers (at 09:08:32) when speed had been reduced to about 600 meters/second, and scientific instruments began to collect and transmit data (to the flyby vehicle) as the probe descended. The only useful data was, however, 
directly from the lander to Earth, and its infor-mation was rather ﬁweakﬂ and difficult to decode. It appeared that the lander was rocking back and forth under its parachute far more vigorously than expected. Nevertheless, Mars 6 returned the first 
direct measurements of the temperature and 
pressure of the Martian atmosphere as well as its 
chemical composition (using the radio-frequency mass spectrometer) to Earth. The data indicated 
that argon made up about one-third of the Martian atmosphere. Moments before the expected land
-ing, the ground lost contact with the probe. The last confirmed data was information on ignition of 
the soft-landing engines received about 2 seconds before impact, the probe landing at 09:11:05 UT at 23.9° S / 19.5° W. Later investigation never con
-clusively identified a single cause of loss of con-tact. Probable reasons included failure of the radio system or landing in a geographically rough area. The Mars 6 flyby bus, meanwhile, collected some 
scientific information during its short flyby (at a 
minimum range of 1,600 kilometers to the surface) before heading into heliocentric orbit.143

1973. En route to Mars, there were failures in the 
communications systems, and controllers were forced to maintain contact via the only remaining radio-communications complex. On 9 March 1974, 
the flyby spacecraft ordered the lander capsule to 
separate for its entry into the Martian atmosphere. Although the lander initially refused to ﬁacceptﬂ the command to separate, it eventually did. Ulti-mately, the lander™s main retro-rocket engine failed 

to fire to initiate entry into the Martian atmo-sphere. As a result, the lander flew by the planet at 

a range of 1,300 kilometers and eventually entered 
heliocentric orbit. The flyby probe did, however, 

manage to collect data during its encounter with 
the Red Planet while contact was maintained until 25˜March 1974. Both the failures on Mars 4 (com
-puter failure) and 7 (retro-rocket ignition failure) 
were probably due to the faulty transistors installed 
in the circuits of the onboard computer which were detected prior to launch. Data from Mars 7 was being analyzed as late as 2003 when researchers 
published results based on data collected by the 

KM-73 cosmic ray detector in September 1973 en 
route to Mars.144

mission; the first to use gravity-assist to change its flight-path; the first to return to its target after 
an initial encounter; and the first to use the solar 
wind as a major means of spacecraft orientation 
during flight. The primary goal of the Mariner 10 
was to study the atmosphere (if any), surface, and 

physical characteristics of Mercury. Soon after 

leaving Earth orbit, the spacecraft returned strik-ing photos of both Earth and the Moon as it sped 

to its first destination, Venus. During the coast, 

there were numerous technical problems, includ-ing malfunctions in the high-gain antenna and the 
attitude control system. In January 1974, Mariner 
10 successfully returned data (sans photographs)

on Comet C/1973 E1 Kohoutek, the first time a 
spacecraft returned data on a long-period comet. 
After mid-course corrections on 13˜November 
1973 and 21˜January 1974, Mariner 10 approached 
Venus for a gravity-assist maneuver to send it 
towards Mercury. On 5 February 1974, the space
-craft began returning images of Venus, the first 
picture showing the day-night terminator of the 
planet as a thin bright line. Overall, Mariner 10 
returned a total of 4,165 photos of the Venus 
and collected important scientific data during its 
encounter. Closest flyby range was 5,768 kilo
-meters at 17:01 UT on 5 February. Assisted by 
Venusian gravity, the spacecraft now headed to the 
innermost planet, which it reached after another 
mid-course correction on 16 March 1974. As 
Mariner 10 approached Mercury, photos began to 
show a very Moon-like surface with craters, ridges, 
and chaotic terrain. The spacecraft™s magnetome
-ters revealed a weak magnetic field. Radiometer 
readings suggested nighttime temperatures of 
Œ183°C and maximum daytime temperatures 
of 187°C. Closest encounter came at 20:47 UT 
on 29 March 1974 at a range of 703 kilometers. 
An occultation experiment as the vehicle crossed 
behind the nightside of the planet indicated a lack 
of an atmosphere or ionosphere. Leaving Mercury 
behind, the spacecraft looped around the Sun 
and headed back to its target, helped along by 
subsequent course corrections on 9 May, 10 May, 
and 2 July 1974. Mariner 10 flew by Mercury once 
more on at 20:59 UT on 21 September 1974 at 
a more distant 48,069 kilometers range, adding 
imagery of the southern polar region. The space-craft used solar pressure on its solar panels and 
high-gain antenna for attitude control. Mariner 10 
once again sped away from Mercury before a final 
and third encounter with Mercury, enabled by 
three maneuvers (on 30 October 1974, 13 February 
1975, and 7 March 1975), the last one actually to 
avoid impact with the planet. The third flyby, at 
22:39 UT on 16 March 1975, was the closest to 
Mercury, at a range of 327 kilometers. Because of 
the failure of a tape recorder and restrictions in the 
rate of data reception, only the central quarter of 
each of 300 high resolution images was received 
during this encounter. Last contact with the space
-craft was at 12:21 UT on 24 March 1975 after the 
spacecraft exhausted its supply of gas for attitude 
control. Overall, Mariner 10 returned over 2,700 
pictures during its three Mercury flybys that cov-ered nearly half of the planet™s surface. Some of the 
images showed detail as small as 100 meters wide. 
Perhaps the most impressive surface feature was 
the Caloris basin, characterized by a set of concen-tric rings and ridges and about 2,500 kilometers in 
diameter. The mission was the last visit to Mercury 
by a robotic probe for more than 30˜years.123

Results: Luna 22 was the second of two ﬁadvancedﬂ 
lunar orbiters (the first being Luna 19) designed to conduct extensive scientific surveys from orbit. Launched about a year after termination of Lunokhod 2 operations on the lunar surface, Luna 
22 performed a single mid-course correction en route the Moon on 30 May before entering lunar 
orbit on 2 June 1974. Initial orbital parameters were 219 × 222 kilometers at 19° 35˜ inclination. An orbital correction on 9 June put the spacecraft 
in its nominal orbit of 244 × 25 kilometers for its primary imaging mission. The spacecraft carried out four mapping sessions; a fifth one was canceled due to a significant decrease in the perilune from 24.5 kilometers (on 9 June) to 15.4 kilometers (on 12 June). Nevertheless, Luna 22 provided the best Soviet imagery of the Moon. In addition to its pri
-mary mission of surface photography, Luna 22 also 
performed investigations to determine the chem-ical composition of the lunar surface, recorded meteoroid activity, searched for a lunar magnetic 
field, measured solar and cosmic radiation flux, and continued studies of the irregular magnetic 
field. Through various orbital changesŠincluding a burn on 11 November 1974 to put the vehicle into a high 1,437 × 171-kilometer orbit to conduct 
gravitational experimentsŠLuna 22 performed without any problems, continuing to return photos 15 months into the mission, although its primary mission ended by 2 April 1975. The spacecraft™s 
maneuvering propellant was finally depleted on 2˜September and the highly successful mission was 
formally terminated in early November 1975. Luna 
22 remains the final Soviet or Russian dedicated lunar orbiter.

UTLaunch Site: NIIP-5 / Site 81/24
Scientific Instruments:1. stereo imaging system2. LB09 drill for sample collection3. radiation detector4. radio altimeterResults: Luna 23 was the first modified lunar sample return spacecraft, designed to return a deep core sample of the Moon™s surface (hence the change 
in index from Ye-8-5 to Ye-8-5M). The main dif
-ferences were the use of a new drilling and sam-pling instrument, the LB09, the removal of the low-altitude Kvant altimeter, and lightening of the 
torroidal instrument compartment. The diameter of the container containing soil in the return capsule had also been increased from 68 to 100 mm. While Luna 16 and 20 had returned samples from a depth 
of 0.3 meters, the new spacecraft was designed to dig to 2.3 meters. After a mid-course correction 
on 31 October, Luna 23 entered orbit around the 
moon on 2 November 1974. Parameters were 104 
× 94 kilometers at 138° inclination. Following 
several more changes to the orbit, the spacecraft descended to the lunar surface on November˜6. 
The first part of the descent occurred without anomalies until the vehicle was at 2.28-kilometer altitude. At that point, the DA-018 Doppler radar 
was switched on to provide data on the final stage of descent. At a height of 130 meters, however, 
all altitude measurements stopped. Nevertheless, the vehicle managed to land in one piece despite a landing velocity of 11 meters/second (instead of 5 meters/second). Landing was in the southernmost 
portion of Mare Crisium at 12° 41˜ N / 62° 17˜˜E. 
As a result of the hard landing, equipment on the lander was damagedŠthere was a depressuriza-tion of the instrument compartment and failure of a transmitter. Subsequent attempts to activate 
the drill all failed, preventing fulfillment of the 
primary mission, the return of lunar soil to Earth. Controllers devised a makeshift plan to conduct a limited science exploration program with the sta-tionary lander and maintained contact with the spacecraft until 9 November 1974. Images from NASA™s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) in 
2012 showed that Luna 23 was actually laying on its side on the lunar surface.147

Results: Helios 1 was a joint German-U.S. deep space mission to study the main solar processes 
and solar-terrestrial relationships. Specifically, 
the spacecraft™s instruments were designed to 
investigate phenomena such as solar wind, mag-netic and electric fields, cosmic rays, and cosmic dust in regions between Earth™s orbit and approx
-imately 0.3 AU from the Sun. It was the largest

 paying about $180 million of the total $260 mil-lion cost. The Federal Republic of Germany (West 
Germany) provided the spacecraft, named after the Greek god of the Sun, and NASA the launch vehi-cles. After launch, Helios 1 entered into a parking 
orbit around Earth and then sent into an ellipti
-cal orbit around the Sun at 0.985 × 0.3095 AU at 
0.02° inclination to the ecliptic. The Centaur boost stage on this mission, after separation from the first stage, conducted a set of maneuvers to provide data for the (then-called) Mariner Jupiter-Saturn 
missions planned for launches in 1977. By January 1975, control of the mission had been transferred from the U.S. to West Germany, which faced a 
few minor communications problems, especially with antennas for both the American and German 
plasma wave experiments. On 15 March 1975, Helios 1 passed within 46 million kilometers of 
the Sun (at perihelion) at a speed of 238,000 kilo-meters/hour, a distance that was the closest any 
human-made object had been to our nearest star. 
The spacecraft achieved a second close flyby of the Sun on 21 September 1975 when temperatures on its solar cells reached 132°C. During its mission, the spacecraft spun once every second to evenly distribute the heat coming from the Sun, 90% of which was reflected by optical surface mirrors. Its data indicated the presence of 15 times more micrometeoroids close to the Sun than there are near Earth. Helios 1™s data was correlated with 
the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) Explorers 47 and 50 in Earth orbit, the Pioneer solar orbiters, and Pioneer 10 and 11 leaving the solar system. Data was received through the late 1970s and early 1980s but after 1984, both pri-mary and backup receivers failed and the high-gain antenna lost tracking of Earth. Last telemetry from 
the spacecraft was received on 10 February 1986 
after which the spacecraft automatically shut down its transmitter due to lack of power.

Results: Venera 9 was the first of a new generation 
of Soviet space probes (ﬁ4Vﬂ) designed to explore Venus, and designed on the basis of the M-71 and 
M-73 Mars platforms. Launched by the more pow-erful Proton-K launch booster, the new spacecraft 

were nearly five times heavier than their prede-cessors. Each spacecraft comprised of both a bus and a lander, the former equipped with a power
-ful 11D425A engine capable of 1,928 kgf thrust (throttleable down to 1,005 kgf). For this series 

of missions, the 2,300-kilogram (mass at Venus 
orbit insertion) buses would serve as orbiters pho-tographing the planet in ultraviolet light and con-ducting other scientific investigations. The 660 
kilogram landers, of a completely new design, 
employed aerodynamic braking during Venusian 
atmospheric entry and contained a panoramic 
photometer to take images of the surface. During 128
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
the coast to Venus, they would be packed inside a 
1,560-kilogram spherical reentry pod with a diam
-eter of 2.4 meters. Without any apparent problems 
and two trajectory corrections (on 16 June and 15 October), Venera 9™s lander separated from its 
parent on 20˜October 1975 and two days later hit 
Venus™ turbulent atmosphere at a velocity of 10.7 
kilometers/hour. After aerodynamic deceleration, 
the cover of the parachute compartments was jet-tisoned at about 65 kilometers altitude, with two parachutes (one a drogue and the second to remove 
the upper portions of the heat shield casing) suc-cessively deployed. Descent velocity reduced, as a result, from 250 meters/second to 150 meters/second. At that point, a long drag parachute 
deployed and data transmission began. The drag parachute decreased descent velocity down to 50 meters/second before, finally, at 62 kilometers atti
-tude, three large canopy parachutes deployed (with a total area of 180 m2). Four seconds after deploy
-ment, the lower hemisphere of the heat-shield casing was discarded. The now fully deployed descent vehicle descended for approximately 20 minutes before the main parachutes were jetti-soned. The rest of the descent was slowed only by the capsule™s own disc-shaped aerobrakes. The 
lander impacted on the surface at a velocity of approximately 7 meters/second. Pravda noted on 21 February 1976 that ﬁthe landing units, which 
are thin-walled torroidal shells, were deformed [as planned] during landing, thereby absorbing the energy of the impact and assured an oriented posi-tion of the descent vehicle on the planet.ﬂ Land-ing occurred on the planet™s dayside at 05:13:07 
UT on 22 October. (Times were only announced 
for reception of landing signal on Earth). Landing coordinates were within a 150-kilometer radius of 31.01° N / 290.64° E at the base of a hill near Beta Regio. During its 53 minutes of transmissions from 
the surface, Venera 9 took and transmitted the very 
first picture of the Venusian surface, taken from a 
height of 90 centimeters. These were, in fact, the very first photos received of the surface of another planet. The lander was supposed to transmit a full 360° panorama, but because one of the two covers on the camera failed to release, only a 180° panorama was received. Illumination was akin to a cloudy day on Earth. The image clearly showed flat rocks strewn around the lander. The Venera 9 
orbiter meanwhile entered a 1,510 × 112,200-kilo-meter orbit around the planet at 34° 10
˜ inclina-tion and acted as a communications relay for the lander. It became the first spacecraft to go into 
orbit around Venus. The Soviets announced on 
22 March 1976 that the orbiter™s primary mission, 
which included using French-made ultraviolet 
cameras to obtain photographs in 1,200 kilometer swaths, had been˜fulfilled.149

return data from the surface. The spacecraft fol-lowed an identical mission to its twin, arriving only 
a few days later after two trajectory corrections on 21 June and 18 October 1975. The 1,560-kilogram lander separated from its parent on 23 October and entered the atmosphere two days later at 01:02 UT. 
During reentry, the lander survived loads as high 
as 168 g™s and temperatures as high 12,000°C. It 
performed its complex landing procedures without fault (see Venera 9 for details) and landed without 
incident at 05:17:06 UT approximately 2,200 kilo-meters from the Venera 9 landing site. (Times were 
only announced for reception of landing signal on 
Earth). Landing coordinates were a 150-kilometer radius of 15.42° N / 291.51° E. Venera 10 trans
-mitted for a record 65 minutes from the surface, although it was designed to last only 30 minutes. A photo of the Venera 10 landing site showed a 
smoother surface than that of its twin. The small image size was part of the original plan, and was determined by the slow telemetry rates and an estimated 30-minute lifetime. Like Venera 9, the 
Venera 10 lander was supposed to take a 360° 
panorama but covered only 180° of the surround-ings because of a stuck lens cover. Soviet officials 
later revealed that termination of data reception from both Venera 9 and 10 landers was not due 
to the adverse surface conditions but because the orbiter relays for both spacecraft flew out of view. 
Gamma-ray spectrometer and radiation densitome
-ter (shaped a bit like a paint-roller deployed on the surface) data indicated that the surface layer was akin to basalt rather than granite as hinted by the information from Venera 8. The Venera 10 orbiter 
meanwhile entered a 1,620 × 113,000-kilometer orbit around Venus inclined at 29° 30
˜, transmitting data until at least June 1976. Unlike the Venera 9 
orbiter, photographs taken by the Venera 10 orbiter 
were never released and it remains unclear whether it actually carried a camera.150

Results: Viking 1 was the first of a pair of complex 
deep space probes that were designed to reach 
Mars and collect evidence on the possibility (or 
lack of) for life on Mars. Each spacecraft was com-posed of two primary elements, an orbiter (2,339 
kilograms) and a lander (978 kilograms). The 

Orbiter design heavily borrowed from the Mariner 
buses, while the Lander looked superficially like a 
much larger version of the Surveyor lunar lander. 

Prior to launch, the batteries of the first spacecraft 

were discharged, prompting NASA to replace the 
original first spacecraft with the second, which 
was launched as Viking 1. After three mid-course 

corrections (on 27 August 1975, and 10 and 15 

June 1976), the spacecraft entered orbit around 
Mars on 19 June 1976. Initial orbital parameters 
were 1,500 × 50,300 kilometers. The following 

day, the orbiter moved into an operational orbit at 

1,500 × 32,800 kilometers. The same day, when 
the Orbiter began transmitting back photos of the 

primary landing site in the Chryse region, scien-tists discovered that the area was rougher than 
expected. Using the new photos, scientists tar-geted the lander to a different site on the western 
slopes of Chryse Planitia (ﬁGolden Plainﬂ). The 

Lander separated from the Orbiter at 08:32 UT 
on 20 July 1976, and after a complicated atmo
-spheric entry sequence during which the probe 
took air samples, Viking Lander 1 set down safely 

at 22.483° N / 47.94° N at 11:53:06 UT on 20˜July 
1976 (about 28 kilometers from its planned 
target). Once down, the spacecraft began taking 

high-quality photographs (in three colors) of its 

surroundings. Besides high-resolution images, the 
lander also took a 300° panorama of its surround-ings that showed not only parts of the spacecraft 
itself but also the gently rolling plains of the envi-rons. Instruments recorded temperatures ranging 
131
1975
 from Œ86°C (before dawn) to Œ33°C (in the after-noon). The seismometer on the lander was, how-ever, inoperable. On 28 July, the lander™s robot 
arm scooped up the first soil samples and depos-ited them into a special biological laboratory that 
included a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. 

The cumulative data from the four samples col
-lected could be construed as indicating the pres-ence of life (ﬁweak positiveﬂ), but the major test for 

organic compounds using the gas chromatograph 

experiment, capable of detecting organic com-pounds that comprised more than 10Œ100 parts 

per billion in the soil, gave negative results. Data 
showed an abundance of sulfur, certainly different 

from any known material found on Earth or the 

Moon. While the primary mission for both Viking 
1 and Viking 2 ended in November 1976, activ
-ities continued through the Extended Mission 
(November 1976 to May 1978) and the Contin
-uation Mission (May 1978 to July 1979). Viking 
1™s orbiter then continued a ﬁSurvey Missionﬂ from 
July 1979 to July 1980. The Lander continued to 

return daily (and then eventually weekly) weather 

reports as part of the Viking Monitor Mission. In 
January 1982, it was renamed the Thomas Mutch 
Memorial Station in honor of Thomas A. Mutch

After a successful launch and a mid-course cor-rection on 19 September 1975, Viking 2 entered 
orbit around Mars nearly a year after launch on 

7 August 1976. Initial orbital parameters were 
1,502 × 35,728 kilometers inclined at 55.6°. As 
with Viking 1, photographs of the original land
-ing site indicated rough terrain, prompting mis
-
sion planners to select a different site at Utopia 
Planitia near the edge of the polar ice cap where 
water was located, i.e., where there was a better 

chance of finding signs of life. The Lander sepa-rated from the Orbiter without incident at 20:19 
UT on 3 September 1976 and after atmospheric 
entry, landed safely at 22:37:50 UT, about 6,460 

kilometers from the Viking 1 landing site. Touch
-down coordinates were 47.968° N / 225.71° W. 
Photographs of the area showed a rockier, flat
-ter site than that of Viking 1. The lander was in 

fact tilted 8.5° to the west. Panoramic views of 

the landscape showed a terrain different from 

that of Viking 1, with much less definition and

very little in the way of horizon features. Because 
of the lack of general topographical references on the ground, imagery from the orbiters was unable to precisely locate the lander. The biology exper
-iments with scooped up soil collected on three occasions (beginning on 12 September) produced similar results to its twin, i.e., inconclusive on the question of whether life exists or ever has existed 
on the surface of Mars. Scientists believed that 
Martian soil contained reactants created by ultra-violet bombardment of the soil that could produce characteristics of living organisms in Earth soil. On 16 November 1976, NASA announced that both Viking 1 and Viking 2 missions had successfully 
accomplished their mission goals and announced 
an Extended Mission that continued until May 1978 followed by a Continuation Mission until July 1979. The Orbiter continued its successful imaging mission, approaching as close as 28 kilo-meters to the Martian Moon Deimos in May 1977. A series of leaks prompted termination of Orbiter 2 operations on 24 July 1978 while the Lander 2 
continued to transmit data until 12 April 1980. 
In July 2001, the Viking 2 lander was renamed 
the Gerald Soffen Memorial Station after Gerald Soffen (1926Œ2000), the NASA Project Scien-tist for Viking who had died recently. In total, the 
two Viking Orbiters returned 52,663 images of 
Mars and mapped about 97% of the surface at a resolution of 300 meters resolution. The Landers returned 4,500 photos of the two landing sites.152

Faraday effect experiment
Results: Helios 2 was the second spacecraft launched 
to investigate solar processes as part of cooperative 
project between the Federal Republic of Germany 
and the United States in which the former provided 
the spacecraft and the latter the launch vehicle. 

Although similar to Helios 1, the second spacecraft 

had improved systems designed to help it survive 
longer. Like its twin, the spacecraft was put into helio
-centric orbit; all communications with the spacecraft 
was directed from the German Space Operation 

Center near Munich. In contrast to Helios 1, Helios 
2, flew three million kilometers closer to the Sun, 
achieving perihelion on 17 April 1976 at a distance 
of 0.29 AU (or 43.432 million kilometers), a distance 

that makes Helios 2 the record holder for the clos-est ever flyby of the Sun. As a result, the spacecraft 
was exposed to 10% more heat (or 20°C more) than 
its predecessor. The spacecraft provided important 

information on solar plasma, the solar wind, cosmic 

rays, and cosmic dust, and also performed magnetic 

field and electrical field experiments. Besides its 
investigation of the Sun and solar environment, both 
Helios 1 and Helios 2 observed the dust and ion tails 

of at least three comets, C/1975V1 West, C/1978H1 

Meier, and C/1979Y1 Bradfield. Helios 2™s downlink 
transmitter, however, failed on 3 March 1980 and 
no further usable data was received from the space-craft. Ground controllers shut down the spacecraft 

on 7˜January 1981 to preclude any possible radio 
interference with other spacecraft in the future.A technician stands next to one of the

Scientific Instruments:1. stereo imaging system2. LB09 drill for sample collection3. radiation detector4. radio altimeterResults: Luna 24 was the third attempt to recover a sample from the unexplored Mare Crisium (after Luna 23 and a subsequent launch failure 
in October 1975), the location of a large lunar mascon. After a trajectory correction on 11 August 
1976, Luna˜24 entered orbit around the Moon 
three days later. Initial orbital parameters were 115 
× 115 kilometers at 120° inclination. After further 
changes to its orbit on 16 and 17 August, which 
brought the orbit down to an elliptical 120 × 12 kilometers, Luna 24 began its descent to the sur-face at perilune by firing its descent engine. Just 6 
minutes later, the spacecraft set down safely on the 
lunar surface at 06:36 UT on 18 August 1976 at 12° 
45˜˜N / 62° 12
˜˜E (as announced at the time), not 
far from where Luna 23 had landed. Later analysis showed that the spacecraft landed just 10 meters from the rim of a 65-meter diameter impact crater. 
After appropriate commands from ground control, within 15 minutes of landing, the lander deployed its sample arm and pushed its drilling head (using a rotary drilling mode) about 2.25 meters into the nearby soil. Because the drill entered at an angle, the probable surface depth of the sample was 
about 2 meters. The sample was safely stowed in the small return capsule, and after nearly a day on the Moon, Luna˜24 lifted off successfully 
from the Moon at 05:25 UT on 19 August 1976. 
After an uneventful return trip lasting 84 hours, Luna 24™s capsule entered Earth™s atmosphere and 
parachuted down to Earth safely at 05:55 UT on 23˜August 1976 about 200 kilometers southeast 
of Surgut in western Siberia. Study of the recov
-ered 170.1 grams of soil indicated a laminated type structure, as if laid down in successive deposits. 
Tiny portions of the sample were exchanged with 
NASA in December 1976. At the time, the Luna 
24 sample puzzled investigators because its tita-nium content and ﬁmaturityﬂ (amount of time the sample was exposed to the space environment) were very different than expected at Mare Crisium. Images from NASA™s Lunar Reconnaissance 
Orbiter (LRO) in 2012 showed that lander sam-pled impact ejecta from a nearby 64-meter diam-eter crater that brought up material from deeper lava flows that had not been previously exposed to the space environment. Thus, the Luna 24 sample probably represented subsurface materials only exposed to the space environment for a relatively short time. LRO images helped refine the landing target area as 12.7146° N / 62.2129°˜E, which was 
only 2.32 kilometers from the crashed Luna 23. 
Luna 24 remains the last Soviet or Russian probe to the Moon. A Japanese spacecraft (Hiten, 
page 179) returned to the Moon nearly 14 years later.

Results: The two-spacecraft Voyager missions were 
designed to replace original plans for a ﬁGrand 
Tourﬂ of the planets that would have used four 
highly complex spacecraft to explore the five outer 
planets during the late 1970s. NASA canceled the 

plan in January 1972 largely due to anticipated 

costs (projected at $1 billion) and instead proposed 
to launch only two spacecraft in 1977 to Jupiter and 
Saturn. The two spacecraft were designed to 

explore the two gas giants in more detail than the 
two Pioneers (Pioneers 10 and 11) that preceded 

them. In 1974, mission planners proposed a mis-
sion in which, if the first Voyager was successful, 
the second one could be redirected to Uranus and 
then Neptune using gravity assist maneuvers. Each 

of the two spacecraft were equipped with slow-scan 

color TV to take images of the planets and their 

moons and also carried an extensive suite of instru-ments to record magnetic, atmospheric, lunar, and 

other data about the planetary systems. The design 

of the two spacecraft was based on the older Mari
-ners, and they were known as Mariner 11 and Mar-iner 12 until 7 March 1977 when NASA 

Administrator James C. Fletcher (1919Œ1991) 

announced that they would be renamed Voyager.

Power was provided by three plutonium dioxide 
radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) mounted at the end of a boom. Although launched 
after Voyager 1, Voyager 2 exited the asteroid belt 
after its twin and then followed it to Jupiter and Saturn. Its primary radio transmitter failed on 5˜April 1978 and the spacecraft used its backup 
past that point. Voyager 2 began transmitting 
images of Jupiter on 24 April 1979 for time-lapse 
movies of atmospheric circulation. Unlike Voyager 
1, Voyager 2 made close passes to the Jovian moons 
on its way into the system, with scientists espe-cially interested in more information from Europa 
and Io (which necessitated a 10-hour long ﬁvolcano watchﬂ). During its encounter, it relayed back spec
-tacular photos of the entire Jovian system, includ-ing its moons Callisto, Ganymede, Europa (at 205,720-kilometer range, much closer than Voyager 
1), Io, and Amalthea, all of which had already been 
surveyed by Voyager 1. Voyager 2™s closest encoun
-ter to Jupiter was at 22:29 UT on 9˜July 1979 at a 
range of 645,000 kilometers. It transmitted new data on the planet™s clouds, its newly discovered 
four moons, and ring system as well as 17,000 new pictures. When the earlier Pioneers had flown by 
Jupiter, they noticed few atmospheric changes

 from one encounter to the second; in this case, 
Voyager 2 detected many significant changes, par
-ticular a drift in the Great Red Spot as well as changes in its shape and color. With the combined 
cameras of the two Voyagers, at least 80% of the 

surfaces of Ganymede and Callisto were mapped 
out to a resolution of 5 kilometers. Following a 
mid-course correction 2 hours after its closest 
approach to Jupiter, Voyager 2 sped to Saturn, its 
trajectory determined to a large degree by the deci-sion, taken in January 1981, to try and send the 
spacecraft to Uranus and Neptune later in the 
decade. Its encounter with the sixth planet began on 22 August 1981, two years after leaving the 

Jovian system, with imaging of the moon Iapetus. 
Once again, Voyager 2 repeated the photographic 
mission of its predecessor, although it actually flew 
23,000 kilometers closer to Saturn. Closest High-altitude cloud streaks are visible in Neptune™s atmosphere in a picture taken during Voyager 2™s ˚yby of the gas giant

encounter was at 01:21 UT on 26 August 1981 at 
101,000 kilometer range. The spacecraft provided 
more detailed images of the ring ﬁspokesﬂ and kinks, and also the F-ring and its shepherding moons, all found by Voyager 1. Voyager 2™s data 

suggested that Saturn™s A-ring was perhaps only 

300 meters thick. As it flew behind and up past 
Saturn, the probe passed through the plane of 
Saturn™s rings at a speed of 13 kilometers/second; 

for several minutes during this phase, the space-craft was hit by thousands of micron-sized dust grains that created ﬁpuffﬂ plasma as they were vaporized. Because the vehicle™s attitude was 

repeatedly shifted by the particles, attitude control 
jets automatically fired many times to stabilize the vehicle. During the encounter, Voyager 2 also 
photographed the Saturn moons Hyperion (the ﬁhamburger moonﬂ), Enceladus, Tethys, and 

Phoebe as well as the more recently discovered Helene, Telesto, and Calypso. Although Voyager 2 
had fulfilled its primary mission goals with the two 
planetary encounters, mission planners directed 

the veteran spacecraft to Uranus on a four-and-a-
half-year-long journey during which it covered 33 
AU™s. In fact, its encounter with Jupiter was opti
-mized in part to ensure that future planetary flybys 

would be possible. The Uranus encounter™s geome
-try was also defined by the possibility of a future 
encounter with Neptune: Voyager 2 had only 5.5 

hours of close study during its flyby, the first of any 

human-made spacecraft past the planet Uranus. Long-range observations of the planet began on The 34 meter High Ef˜ciency Antenna in the foreground was nicknamed the ﬁUranus Antennaﬂ because it was built in 
the 1980s to receive signals during Voyager 2™s Uranus encounter. The antenna is located at the Goldstone Deep Space 

Communications Complex in California.

 4˜November 1985 when signals took approximately 
2.5 hours to reach Earth. Light conditions were 400 times less than terrestrial conditions. Closest approach to Uranus took place at 17:59 UT on 24˜January 1986 at a range of 81,500 kilometers. 
During its flyby, Voyager 2 discovered 10 new 
moons (given such names as Puck, Portia, Juliet, 
Cressida, Rosalind, Belinda, Desdemona, Cordelia, Ophelia, and BiancaŠobvious allusions to Shakespeare), two new rings in addition to the ﬁolderﬂ nine rings, and a magnetic field tilted at 55° off-axis and off-center. The spacecraft found wind 
speeds in Uranus™ atmosphere as high as 724 kilo
-meters/hour and found evidence of a boiling ocean of water some 800 kilometers below the top cloud surface. Its rings were found to be extremely vari-able in thickness and opacity. Voyager 2 also 
returned spectacular photos of Miranda, Oberon, Ariel, Umbriel, and Titania, five of Uranus™ larger 
moons. In flying by Miranda at a range of only 28,260 kilometers, the spacecraft came closest to any object so far in its nearly decade-long travels. Images of the moon showed a strange object whose surface was a mishmash of peculiar features that seemed to have no rhyme or reason. Uranus itself appeared generally featureless in the photographs taken. The spectacular news of the Uranus encoun-ter was interrupted the same week by the tragic 
Challenger accident that killed seven astronauts during their Space Shuttle launch on 28 January. 
Following the Uranus encounter, the spacecraft 
performed a single mid-course correction on 14˜February 1986Šthe largest ever made by 
Voyager 2Što set it on a precise course to Neptune. 
Voyager 2™s encounter with Neptune capped a 7 
billion-kilometer journey when on 25˜August 1989 
at 03:56 UT, it flew 4,800 kilometers over the cloud 
tops of the giant planet, the closest of its four flybys. It was the first human-made object to fly by the planet. Its 10 instruments were still in working order at the time. During the encounter, the space
-craft discovered six new moons (Proteus, Larissa, Despina, Galatea, Thalassa, and Naiad) and four 
new rings. The planet itself was found to be more active than previously believed, with 1,100 kilome-ter winds. Hydrogen was found to be the most common atmospheric element, although the abun
-dant methane gave the planet its blue appearance. Images revealed details of the three major features in the planetary cloudsŠthe Lesser Dark Spot, the Great Dark Spot, and Scooter. Voyager photo
-graphed two-thirds of Neptune™s largest moon 
Triton, revealing the coldest known planetary body 
in the solar system and a nitrogen ice ﬁvolcanoﬂ on 
its surface. Spectacular images of its southern 
hemisphere showed a strange, pitted ﬁcanta-loupeﬂ-type terrain. The flyby of Neptune con-cluded Voyager 2™s planetary encounters, which 
spanned an amazing 12 years in deep space, virtu-ally accomplishing the originally planned Grand 
Tour of the solar system, at least in terms of targets 
reached if not in science accomplished. Once past 
the Neptune system, Voyager 2 followed a course 
below the ecliptic plane and out of the solar 
system. Approximately 56 million kilometers past 
the encounter, Voyager 2™s instruments were put in 
low power mode to conserve energy. After the 
Neptune encounter, NASA formally renamed the 
entire project the Voyager Interstellar Mission 
(VIM). Of the four spacecraft sent out to beyond 
the environs of the solar system in the 1970s, three 
of themŠVoyagers 1 and 2 and Pioneer 11Šwere 
all heading in the direction of the solar apex, i.e., 
the apparent direction of the Sun™s travel in the 
Milky Way galaxy, and thus would be expected to 
reach the heliopause earlier than Pioneer 10 which 
was headed in the direction of the heliospheric 
tail. In November 1998, 21 years after launch, 
non-essential instruments were permanently 
turned off, leaving seven instruments still operat-ing. Through the turn of the century, JPL contin
-ued to receive ultraviolet and particle/fields data. 
For example, on 12˜January 2001, an immense 
shock wave that had blasted out of the outer helio
-sphere on 14 July 2000, finally reached Voyager 2. 
During the six-month journey, the shock wave had 
ploughed through the solar wind, sweeping up and 
accelerating charged particles. The spacecraft 
142
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
provided important information on high-energy shock-energized ions. On 30 August 2007, Voyager 

2 passed the termination shock and then entered the heliosheath. By November 5, 2017, the space-craft was 116.167 AU (17.378 billion kilometers) 
from Earth, moving at a velocity of 15.4 kilometers/
second relative to the Sun, heading in the direction of the constellation Telescopium. At this velocity, it 
would take about 19,390 years to traverse a single 
light-year. Data from the remaining five operating 

instrumentsŠthe cosmic ray telescope, the low- energy charged particles experiment, the magne-
tometer, the plasma waves experiment, and the 

plasma spectrometerŠcould be received as late 
as˜2025.This false color image of Jupiter™s Great Red Spot taken by Voyager 1 was assembled from three black-and-white neg

but because of a faster route, it exited the aster-oid belt earlier than its twin, having overtaken Voy
-ager 2 on 15 December 1977. It began its Jovian imaging mission in April 1978 at a range of 265 

million kilometers from the planet; images sent 
back by January the following year indicated that Jupiter™s atmosphere was more turbulent than 
during the Pioneer flybys in 1973Œ1974. Beginning 

on 30 January, Voyager 1 took a picture every 96 
seconds for a span of 100 hours to generate a color 
timelapse movie to depict 10 rotations of Jupiter. 

On 10 February 1979, the spacecraft crossed into 
the Jovian moon system and in early March, it had already discovered a thin (less than 30 kilo-meters thick) ring circling Jupiter. Voyager 1™s clos
-est encounter with Jupiter was at 12:05 UT on 5 March 1979 at a range of 280,000 kilometers, 
following which it encountered several of Jupiter™s 

Moons, including Amalthea (at 420,200-kilometer 

range), Io (21,000 kilometers), Europa (733,760 kilometers), Ganymede (114,710 kilometers), and Callisto (126,400 kilometers), in that order, return
-ing spectacular photos of their terrain, opening up 
a completely new world for planetary scientists. 
The most interesting find was on Io, where images 
showed a bizarre yellow, orange, and brown world 
with at least eight active volcanoes spewing mate-rial into space, making it one of the most (if not the 
most) geologically active planetary body in the solar system. The presence of active volcanoes suggested that the sulfur and oxygen in Jovian space may be a 
result of the volcanic plumes from Io which are rich 
in sulfur dioxide. The spacecraft also discovered two new moons, Thebe and Metis. Following the 
Jupiter encounter, Voyager 1 completed an initial 

course correction on 9 April 1979 in preparation 
Voyager 1 acquired this image of Io on 4 March 1979 about 
11 hours before closest approach to the Jupiter Moon, at 

a range of 490,000 kilometers from the target. Visible is

for its meeting with Saturn. A second correction on 
10˜October 1979 ensured that the spacecraft would 
not hit Saturn™s moon Titan. Its flyby of the Saturn 
system in November 1979 was as spectacular as 
its previous encounter. Voyager 1 found five new 
moons, a ring system consisting of thousands of 
bands, wedge-shaped transient clouds of tiny par-ticles in the B ring that scientists called ﬁspokes,ﬂ a new ring (the ﬁG-ringﬂ), and ﬁshepherdingﬂ satellites on either side of the F-ringŠsatellites that keep the rings well-defined. During its flyby, the space
-craft photographed Saturn™s moons Titan, Mimas, 
Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea. Based on 
incoming data, all the moons appeared to be com
-posed largely of water ice. Perhaps the most inter
-esting target was Titan, which Voyager 1 passed 
at 05:41 UT on 12 November at a range of 4,000 kilometers. Images showed a thick atmosphere 
that completely hid the surface. The spacecraft 
found that the moon™s atmosphere was composed 
of 90% nitrogen. Pressure and temperature at the surface was 1.6 atmospheres and Œ180°C, respec-tively. Atmospheric data suggested that Titan might 
be the first body in the solar system (apart from Earth) where liquid might exist on the surface. In addition, the presence of nitrogen, methane, and more complex hydrocarbons indicated that pre-biotic chemical reactions might be possible on 
Titan. Voyager 1™s closest approach to Saturn was 
at 23:46 UT on 12 November 1980 at a range of 126,000 kilometers. Following the encounter with 
Saturn, Voyager 1 headed on a trajectory escaping 
the solar system at a speed of about 3.5 AU per 
year, 35° out of the ecliptic plane to the north, in 
the general direction of the Sun™s motion relative to 
nearby stars. Because of the specific requirements for the Titan flyby, the spacecraft was not directed 
to Uranus and Neptune. The final images taken by the Voyagers comprised a mosaic of 64 images 
taken by Voyager 1 on February 14, 1990 at a dis
-tance of 40 AU of the Sun and all the planets of the 
solar system (although Mercury and Mars did not appear, the former because it was too close to the 
Sun and the latter because Mars was on the same side of the Sun as Voyager 1 so only its dark side 
faced the cameras). This was the so-called ﬁpale blue dotﬂ image made famous by Cornell Univer-sity professor and Voyager science team member 
Carl Sagan (1934-1996). These were the last of a total of 67,000 images taken by the two spacecraft. All the planetary encounters finally over in 1989, the missions of Voyager 1 and 2 were declared part 
of the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), which 
officially began on 1 January 1990. The goal was to extend NASA™s exploration of the solar system 
beyond the neighborhood of the outer planets to the outer limits of the Sun™s sphere of influence, 
and ﬁpossibly beyond.ﬂ Specific goals include col-lecting data on the transition between the helio-sphere, the region of space dominated by the Sun™s 
magnetic field and solar field, and the interstellar medium. On 17 February 1998, Voyager 1 became 
the most distant human-made object in existence 
when, at a distance of 69.4 AU from the Sun when 
it ﬁovertookﬂ Pioneer 10. On 16 December 2004, Voyager scientists announced that Voyager 1 had 
reported high values for the intensity for the mag-netic field at a distance of 94 AU, indicating that 
it had reached the termination shock and had now entered the heliosheath. The spacecraft finally 
exited the heliosphere and began measuring the interstellar environment on 25 August 2012, the 
first spacecraft to do so. On 5 September 2017, 
NASA marked the 40th anniversary of its launch, as it continues to communicate with NASA™s 
Deep Space Network and send data back from four still-functioning instrumentsŠthe cosmic ray telescope, the low-energy charged particles exper
-iment, the magnetometer, and the plasma waves 
experiment. Each of the Voyagers contain a ﬁmes
-sage,ﬂ prepared by a team headed by Carl Sagan, in 
the form of a 30-centimeter diameter gold-plated copper disc for potential extraterrestrials who might find the spacecraft. Like the plaques on Pioneers 10 and 11, the record has inscribed symbols to show the location of Earth relative to several pul-sars. The records also contain instructions to play them using a cartridge and a needle, much like a 145
1977
 vinyl record player. The audio on the disc includes 
greetings in 55 languages, 35 sounds from life on Earth (such as whale songs, laughter, etc.), 90 min
-utes of generally Western music including every
-thing from Mozart and Bach to Chuck Berry and Blind Willie Johnson. It also includes 115 images 
of life on Earth and recorded greetings from then U.S. President Jimmy Carter (1924Œ ) and then-UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim (1918Œ2007). 
By 5 November 2017, Voyager 1 was 140.931 AU 
(21.083 billion kilometers) from Earth, the farthest 
object created by humans, and moving at a velocity 
of 17.0 kilometers/second relative to the Sun.147

1974, the Pioneer Venus project comprised two 
spacecraft to explore the atmosphere and surface of Venus. Both spacecraft used a basic cylindrical 
bus. Pioneer Venus 1, the orbiter, was designed to 
spend an extended period in orbit around Venus 
mapping the surface using a radar package. After 
a six-and-a-half-month-long journey, the space
-craft entered an elliptical orbit around Venus at 
15:58˜UT on 4 December 1978. It was the first 
American spacecraft to enter orbit around Venus, 
about three years after the Soviets accomplished the same feat. The initial orbital period was 23 hours, 11 minutes, which was altered within two orbits to the desired 24 hoursŠa maneuver that would allow the orbit™s high and low points (about 
160 kilometers) to occur at the same time each Earth day. Data from the radar mapper allowed sci
-entists to produce a topographical map of most of the Venusian surface between 73° N and 63° S at a 
resolution of 75 kilometers. The data indicated that Venus was much more smooth and spherical than 
Earth. The orbiter identified the highest point on 
Venus as Maxwell Montes, which rises 10.8 kilome
-ters above the mean surface. Infrared observations implied a clearing in the planet™s atmosphere over 
the north pole. In addition, ultraviolet light photos showed dark markings that covered the clouds in the visible hemisphere. Cameras also detected almost continuous lightning activity in the atmo-sphere. The spacecraft confirmed that Venus has 
little, if any magnetic field. Because of the nature of 
its orbit, Pioneer Venus 1 passed through the plan
-et™s bow shock twice per revolution, and using its 
magnetometer, scientists were able to observe how 
the planet™s ionosphere interacted with the solar 
wind. Although the mapping radar was switched 
off on 19 March 1981 (having mapped 93% of the 148
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
band between 74° N and 63° S), it was reactivated again in 1991, 13 years after launch, to explore the 
previously inaccessible southern portions of the planet. In May 1992, Pioneer Venus 1 began the 
final phase of its mission, maintaining its periapsis 
between 150 and 250 kilometers until propellant 
depletion. The last transmission was received at 19:22 UT on 8 October 1992, as its decaying orbit no longer permitted communications. The space-craft burned up the atmosphere soon after, ending 

a successful 14-year mission that was planned to last only eight months.158

Results: Pioneer Venus 2, the twin to Pioneer Venus 
1, comprised a main bus, a Large Probe (316.5 kilograms), and three identical Small Probes, all of which were designed to collect data during inde-pendent atmospheric entry into Venus. The probes 
were each shaped like cones and not designed to 
survive past surface impact. After a course correc
-tion on 16 August 1978, Pioneer Venus 2 released 

the 1.5 diameter Large Probe on 16 November 
1978, while about 11.1 million kilometers from 
the planet. Four days later, the bus released the 
three Small Probes (North, Day, and Night Probes) 
while 9.3 million kilometers from Venus. All five 

components reached the Venusian atmosphere on 

9 December 1978, with the Large Probe entering first. Using a combination of air drag and a para-chute, the Large Probe descended through the 
atmosphere, entering at a velocity of 11.6 kilo-meters/second, slowing down, until it impacted 149
1978
 on the Venusian surface at 19:40 UT, landing at 
4.4° N / 304.0° longitude at a velocity of 32 kilo-meters/hour. Transmissions ceased at impact as 
expected. The three 76-centimeter diameter Small 
Probes arrived in the atmosphere within minutes of the bigger one and descended rapidly through the atmosphere without the benefit of parachutes. They each opened their instrument doors at alti-tudes of about 70 kilometers and began to trans-mit information about the Venusian atmosphere 
immediately. Each took about 53Œ56 minutes to 
reach the surface. Amazingly, two of three probes 
survived the hard impact. The so-called Day Probe 
transmitted data from the surface for 67 minutes, 37 seconds, before succumbing to the high tem-peratures, pressures, and power depletion. Infor
-mation from its nephelometer indicated that dust raised from its impact took several minutes to 
settle back to the ground. All three Small Probes 
suffered instrument failures, but not significant enough to jeopardize their main missions. Their landing coordinates were: 60° N / 4° E longitude (North Probe); 32° S / 318° E (Day Probe); and 27° S / 56° E (Night Probe). The main bus, mean-while, burned up in the atmosphere at an altitude 
of 120 kilometersŠabout 1.5 hours after the other 
probesŠand provided key data on higher regions. 
Data from the probes indicated that between 10 and 50 kilometers there is almost no convection 
in the atmosphere, while below a haze layer at 30 kilometers, the atmosphere is relatively clear. In 
addition, below an altitude of 50 kilometers, the temperatures reported from the four probes indi
-cated very little differences even though their entry sites were separated by thousands of kilometers.159

NASA built the first and 
third spacecraft while ESA built the second. The three spacecraft were to simultaneously investi-gate a wide range of phenomena in interplane-tary space. After launch, on 20 November 1978, 
ISEE-3 was successfully placed in a halo orbit around the L1 SunŒEarth Lagrange Point on the 
sunward side of Earth, about 1.5 million kilome-ters from Earth where the gravitational forces of 
Earth and the Sun are exactly counterbalanced. ISEE-3 became not only the first spacecraft to be put into orbit around a libration point, but also the 
first spacecraft to monitor the solar wind approach-ing Earth. ISEE-3 completed its primary mission in 1981, but Goddard Space Flight Center scien-tists proposed sending the spacecraft first, through 150
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Earth™s magnetic tail, and second, into position to 
intercept a comet. By 10 June 1982, the spacecraft began to use its thrusters to move into the tail of Earth™s magnetosphere. ISEE-3 completed the 
first deep survey of Earth™s tail and detected a huge 
plasmoid of electrified gas that was ejected from 
Earth™s magnetosphere. After a proposal by NASA 
scientist Robert Farquhar, NASA agreed in August 
1982 to redirect the spacecraft for a rendezvous 
with Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. Subsequently, 
after a series of five complex flybys of the Moon (the last on 22 December 1983 at a range of only 120 kilometers), ISEE-3 was sent on a trajectory to encounter the comet. At this point, the space
-craft was renamed the International Cometary Explorer (ICE). On 11 September 1985 at 11:02 UT, ICE passed within 7,862 kilometers of the 
comet™s nucleus, becoming the first spacecraft to 
fly past a comet. The spacecraft returned excellent 
data on the comet™s tail, confirming theories that 
comets are essentially ﬁdirty snowballsﬂ of ice, with surface material sleeting off during motion. ICE 
also flew to 40.2 million kilometers of the sunward side of Comet Halley on 28 March 1986 and pro-vided upstream solar wind data. After daily data 
return was ended in December 1995, NASA even-tually terminated ICE operations and support on 5 May 1997 although the spacecraft™s transmitter 
was left on in order to facilitate tracking. In 2014, a team of independent scientists, engineers, and 
programmers organized an effort to ﬁrecaptureﬂ the spacecraft during its planned return to the vicinity of Earth in August 2014. The stated goal was to 
have ICE enter an orbit near Earth and ﬁresume its original missionﬂ with its 5 remaining operational instruments. With funding that came entirely from 
the public, the project achieved a new footing by signing an agreement with NASA in May 2014 that allowed the ISEE-3 Reboot Team to make use of a 
defunct NASA spacecraft. A first firing of thrusters 
on 2 July, the first time in 27 years, was successful 
but a longer firing on 8 July failed, probably due to a lack of nitrogen. In the event, the spacecraft passed by the Moon at 18:16 UT on 10 August 
2014 at a range of 15,600 kilometers, just as had been expected years before. The spacecraft will continue in its existing trajectory (in heliocentric 
orbit) and return to the vicinity of Earth in 17 years.160

Results: Venera 11 was one of two identical probes 
(the other being Venera 12) that followed up on 
the highly successful Soviet missions to Venus 
in 1975. Venera 11 and 12 differed from their 
predecessors principally in the fact each carried 
a flyby bus + lander combination instead of the 
previous orbiter + lander combination. Engineers 
reverted to the flyby combination partly because 
of the weight limitations of the 1978 launch 
window, but also because flyby probes afforded 
better transmission time for landers. Several of 
the scientific instruments were also modified and 
new ones added. During the outbound trip to 
Venus, Venera 11 was beset with technical prob
-lems. In the very first communications session 
with the spacecraft, it became apparent that the 
solar orientation system failed (coinciding with 
the deployment of the VHF and UHF antennae). 
Proper orientation was restored soon enough, 
with Venera 11 in a nominal constant solar-stel
-lar orientation mode, although this was main-tained only intermittently. There were also failures 
of the primary and backup fans of the cooling 
system on the descent module detected immedi-ately after launch. On 17˜October, a ﬁcurtainﬂ on 
the radiative heater on the lander was closed, a 
month earlier than planned, to accommodate the 
higher than expected heating. These measures 
appeared to partially work to bring temperatures 
down on the lander. Venera 11 arrived at Venus 
after two course corrections on 16˜September 
and 17 December 1978.˚On 23˜December 1978, 
the lander separated from the flyby probe and 
entered the Venusian atmosphere two days later 
at a velocity of 11.2 kilometers/second. The lander 
probe descended through the atmosphere using 
a system of three progressively larger parachutes 
(areas of 1.4 m2, 6 m2, and 24 m2). At an altitude of 
46 kilometers, the final parachute was jettisoned 
and the lander effective dropped the rest of the 
wayŠfor 52 minutes 58 secondsŠguided only by 
a circular airbrake (with flaps). During this phase 
the lander carried out chemical analyses of the 
composition of the atmosphere and clouds, spec-tral analyses of the scattered solar radiation in the 
atmosphere, studied the electrical discharges in 
the atmosphere, and measured temperature, pres-sure, and windspeeds. The lander safely landed on 
Venus at 03:24 UT on 15 December 1978, impact
-ing at a velocity of approximately 8 meters/second. 
Landing coordinates were 14° S / 299° longitude. 
Within 32 seconds, the imaging system and the 
soil sampling system simultaneously began oper
-ation. The latter collected soil for chemical and 
physical analysis, but soil analysis was unsuccess-ful because the soil was not properly deposited to 
an examination container for analysis (probably 
due to leaking air which disturbed the soil). The 
lander also failed to take color panoramas of the 
Venusian surface due to unopening of the lens 
covers of the camera system. The lander relayed 
information for a total of 95 minutes, the point of 
transmission cutoff being a function of the range 
of visibility of the flyby probe. The spectropho-tometer on Venera 11 reported that only 3Œ6% of 
sunlight actually reached the Venusian surface. 
One of the odd findings was its recording of a loud 
noise some 32 minutes after landing. The Venera 
11 flyby probe entered heliocentric orbit after 
flying past the planet at a range of 35,000 kilome
-ters. A major course correction on 7 February 1979 
(c. 350 meters/second delta-V) was done to ensure 
ideal conditions for the use of the Soviet-French 
Signe-2MZ1 experiment to study the localization 
of gamma-ray bursts, but it exhausted almost all 
of its propellants. As the distance from the Sun 
increased, the bus depended on its gyroscopes for 
orientation. Last contact was on 1 February 1980, 
probably due to improper orientation. The bus™s 
orbit ranged from 1.715 × 1.116 AU.

Results: Venera 12 was the identical sister craft 
to Venera 11 with a bus-lander configuration, 
the latter weighing 1,645 kilograms (mass on the surface of Venus would be 750 kilograms). 
Launched successfully towards Venus, the space
-craft performed two mid-course corrections on 21˜September and 14˜December 1978. During the 
outbound trip one of the telemetry tape record
-ers failed, leading to more frequent use of the 
remaining tape recorder to relay information. As 
planned, on 17˜November controllers closed the 
ﬁcurtainﬂ of the radiation heater to begin cooling down the lander. Further such actions (on 9Œ10 
and 13Œ14 December) brought down the tempera-ture on the lander to a nominal Œ12.3°C although 
by the time of atmospheric entry the temperature 
was up to 5°C. Flying a shorter trajectory than its sister, Venera 12 moved ﬁaheadﬂ of Venera 11, 
and as with its twin, two days prior to the plane-tary encounter, the flyby probe released its lander. 
On 21˜December the lander entered the Venusian 
atmosphere at a velocity of 11.2 kilometers/second and performed a descent profile almost identical to the earlier Veneras 9 and 10 in 1975. Release of the 
final chute occurred at 46 kilometers altitude and for the next 52 minutes and 11 seconds, the lander descended freely with only some airbraking flaps installed on its circular ring for resistance. A vast 
amount of information was collected and relayed to the flyby probe. The lander safely touched down at 
03:30 UT on 21 December 1978. Landing coordi-nates were 7° S / 294° E longitude, about 800 kilo-meters from its twin. From the ground, the probe 
relayed data for a record 110 minutes, although like Venera 11, the spacecraft suffered two major fail
-ures: its soil sample delivery instrument failed to deposit the soil appropriately for scientific analysis; 
and the lens cover on the camera failed to release, effectively rendering the color imaging system useless. The flyby probe passed by the planet at a range of 35,000 kilometers after performing its data 
153
1978
 transmission mission and then entered heliocentric 
orbit with parameters of 0.715 × 1.156 AU. As with 
the Venera 11 flyby probe, a major course correc
-tion (c. 350 meters/second delta-V) on 5 February 
1979 on Venera 12 was designed to ensure proper 
data collection from the Soviet-French Signe-2MZ1 
experiment on the localization of gamma-ray bursts. 
About a year-and-a-half after launch, Venera 12 was 
fortuitously in position to study the newly discov-ered Comet C/1979 Y1 (Bradfield). On 13 February 
1980, the spacecraft was properly oriented (with the 
use of its gyro-platform) to study the comet (which 
was about 50 kilometers closer to the Sun than the 
spacecraft). The DUMS-1 ultraviolet spectrometer 
was used to get a spectral signature of the comet 
both that day and later on 17 March 1980. In mid-
April, the three-axis orientation system on the bus 
failed and the spacecraft was spin-stabilized, which 
prevented further communication after a last ses-sion on 18˜April 1980.155

 12. PrOP-V soil mechanical/electrical probe 13. seismometerResults: Venera 13 was part of the third pair of heavy 
Venus flyby/lander probes launched towards Venus 
by the Soviet Union in the 1970s (after Venera 9/10 
and Venera 11/12). The Soviets picked the landing 
site for Venera 13 based on information passed on 
by NASA from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter vehicle. 
They were supposed to fly in 1980 but the failures 
of the soil sampler and cameras on Venera 11/12 
forced a longer redesign process and these vehi-clesŠespecially the landers (each 1,643.72 kilo-grams) may have been the most rigorously tested 
deep space vehicles ever launched by the Sovi-ets. The ﬁnewﬂ spaceships had an improved set 
of instruments (such as the spectrophotometer, 
the gas chromatograph, and mass spectrometer) 
including a redesigned soil sampler as compared 
with its predecessors. Controllers implemented 
two mid-course corrections on 10 November 1981 
and 21˜February 1982. During the outbound phase, 
there were some anomalies: after the first mid-course correction, for example, there anomalies 
detected in two of the science instruments (Konus 
and RPP-01) and a data tape recorder failed. The 
Venera 13 lander separated from its parent on 
27˜February 1982. The capsule entered the Venu
-sian atmosphere and began relaying atmospheric 
data back to the flyby probe which continued to 
fly past the planet after a 36,000-kilometer range 
encounter. After a roughly 1-hour-long descent, the 
lander set down on the Venusian surface at 03:57:21 
UT on March 1, 1982. Landing velocity was about 
7.5 meters/second and landing coordinates were 
7.55° S / 303.69° E longitude. The probe contin-ued to transmit for another additional 127 minutes, 
far beyond the planned lifetime of 32 minutes. 
The probe found temperature and pressure to be 
462°C and 88.7 atmospheres, respectively. Venera 
13 repeated the attempts at color surface photog-raphy (using red, green, and blue filters) that failed 
on Venera 11 and 12, and succeeded by relaying to 
Earth the first color photographs of the surface of 
Venus. Venera 13 returned eight successive panora
-mas showing a field of orange-brown angular rocks 
and loose soil. Successful soil analysis (which failed 
on Venera 11/12) showed soil similar to terrestrial 
leucitic basalt with a high potassium content. The 
flyby module entered a heliocentric orbit after 
relaying back to Earth all the data collected from 
the lander. Its engine was fired twice, on 10˜June 
and 14 October 1982, as part of a test to provide 
engineering data for the anticipated Halley™s Comet 
flyby by the Vega spacecraft. The bus continued to 
provide data until at least 25 April˜1983.

 12. PrOP-V soil mechanical/electrical probe 13. seismometerResults: Venera 14 was identical to its twin, Venera 
13. The spacecraft carried out two mid-course 
corrections on the way to Venus, on 14 Novem
-ber 1981 and 25 February 1982. There were some 
anomalies en route: failures in the Konus device and erratic temperatures detected in the lander module (the outer shell holding the lander). Like Venera 13, one of the data tape recorders also 
failed. Also, the second mid-course correction 
imparted slightly lower velocity than expected (a shortfall of 1.9 meters/second). Later analysis indi-cated a possible failure in the turbopump assembly 
of the main engine. During flyby and release of the lander, the planned burn of the flyby vehicle was 
increased by 1 minute due to less than expected thrust, to ensure that the flyby bus did not burn up in the Venusian atmosphere and to give sufficient 
time to receive data from the lander. The lander 
probe separated from its flyby parent on 3 March 1982 before the entry cycle began but the flyby vehicle™s main engine provided much less impulse 
than anticipatedŠa shortage of 56.4 meters/
second imparted velocity. Fortunately, this was still 
enough to make sure that the flyby probe did not impact on Venus but it significantly reduced the 
relay time for data. The lander™s main parachute 
opened at an altitude of 63.5 kilometers, thus acti-vating the atmospheric instruments. The parachute 
was released at an altitude of 47 kilometers, and the 750-kilogram lander fell to the surface using only the atmosphere as a retarding medium. The 
probe made safe contact with the Venusian surface 
at 07:00:11 UT on 3 March 1982 and continued 57 minutes of transmissions. Landing coordinates were 13.055° S / 310.19° E longitude, about 1,000 
kilometers from the Venera 13 landing site. As with 
its twin, Venera 14 returned color photographs of its 
surroundings and examined a soil sample (about one 
cubic centimeter taken from a 30-millimeter deep 
sample). Soil was deposited in a chamber sealed off 
from the outside environment and was then suc-cessively transferred through a series of chambers by blowing air until the sample was deposited in its final chamber with a temperature of only 30°C. Here it was examined by the x-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Temperature and pressure outside 
were considerably higher than at the Venera 13 
site: 470°C and 93.5 atmospheres respectively. 
One minor failing of the mission was that one of the ejected caps from the cameras fell just where 
the PrOP-V penetrometers, designed to test soil properties, were about to operate; instead of testing the soil, PrOP-V simply tested the material of the lens cap. The flyby probe meanwhile passed Venus 
at a range of 36,000 kilometersŠmuch closer than 
originally plannedŠand entered heliocentric orbit, 
continuing to provide data on solar x-ray flares. It performed one trajectory change on 14 November 1982 to provide engineering data for the upcoming Vega missions to encounter Halley™s Comet. The 
bus continued to return data until 9 April 1983. 
A minor controversy surrounded the later Venera 
missions when a scientist from the Academy of 
Sciences™ Institute of Space Research, Leonid 
Ksanformaliti, claimed that images from these mis-sions revealed the possibility of ﬁfaunaﬂ on Venus. 
Despite many Russians and Western analysts 
who debunked his claims, in a series of articles in 2012, 2013, and 2014 in the official journal of the Academy, Ksanformaliti insisted that the presence 
of ﬁartificialﬂ and repeating shapes (ﬁstemsﬂ) in the images from Venera 9, 10, 13, and 14 proved 
his hypothesis. All his claims, however, could be 
explained by the technical limitations of transmit-ting the images back to Earth.159

radar mappers designed to extend the studies began by the American Pioneer Venus Orbiter in 
constructing a detailed map of the surface down to about 1Œ2-kilometer resolution. For these mis
-sions, Soviet designers lengthened the central bus of the earlier Veneras (by 1 meter), installed 
much larger solar batteries, and attached a large side-looking radar antenna in place of the descent lander module on the earlier spacecraft. The infra-red spectrometer was provided by the German Democratic Republic. Venera 15 carried out two 
mid-course corrections on 10 June 1983 and 1˜October 1983 before successfully entering orbit 
around Venus at 03:05 UT on 10 October. Initial 
orbital parameters were 904.5 × 64,687 kilome-ters at 87.5° inclination, i.e., a near polar orbit. Two more orbital corrections were carried out on 
17˜October and 2 November leaving the spacecraft 
in an 873 × 65,000-kilometer orbit. The spacecraft™s 
mapping operations began six days after entering orbit, over the north pole. About three months after 
entering Venusian orbit, it was discovered that the 
main omni-directional antennae on both Venera 15 
and 16 were not naturally facing the direction of Earth (connected as they were by the need to have the solar panels constantly facing the direction of the Sun). Instead the solar panels were angled at 45°˜to direct sunlight. Using a special command to 
re-orient the antenna into proper orientation (using springs) in January 1984 proved successful on Venera 16 but not Venera 15. A subsequent engine 
firing on 9 April 1984 shook Venera 15 sufficiently 
that the antenna finally moved into proper orienta-tion. Because of the nature of the spacecraft™s orbit, 
the two orbiters mapped only the area from 30° N to the pole, about 115 million square kilometers. 
The official mission of both vehicles was to end on 10 March 1984 but was extended on account that 
both spacecraft were in excellent condition. The primary photography mission was completed on 10˜July 1984. After that, an ﬁoptional programﬂ of 
scientific work continued through the remainder of 
the year. On 30 December 1984, controllers found 
that the orientation system had exhausted its nitro-gen. Last contact was made with the spacecraft on 5 January 1985.160

UT on 14 October 1983 after en-route course cor
-rections on 15 June and 5 October 1983. Its initial orbital parameters were 977.3 × 67,078 kilome-ters. It began its mapping operations six days later in its 24-hour, 34-minute period near-polar orbit. 
Its operational orbit, reached on 22 October was 944 × 65,336 kilometers, its orbital plane 4° 27˜ inclined to that of its sister craft. Venera 16 typi
-cally followed Venera 15 over the same surface area 
after a three-day gap. Mapping resolution of both Venera 15 and 16 was comparable to that possible 
with the 300-meter dish at Arecibo in Puerto Rico 
although the Soviet orbiters provided coverage over latitudes higher than 30°, too far north for Earth-
based observations. Both spacecraft also used an East German infrared spectrometer to map the planet in infrared wavelengths to provide a ﬁheat atlasﬂ of the atmosphere. The original missions of 
both spacecraft were to end by 10 March 1984 
but due to the excellent condition of the vehicles, ground controllers extended the primary mission into the summer. On 21 June 1984, controllers 
altered Venera 16™s orbit, and less than a month 
later, on 10 July, both vehicles finished their main 
missions, to photograph the northern hemisphere 
of Venus at a resolution of 1Œ2 kilometers. Venera 
16 ended its extended mission rather strangely: on 13 June 1985, controllers were faced with an emer-gency situation on the Vega 1 spacecraft related to 
loss of orientation. A command was sent to Vega 1 
to activate the recovery mode (constant solar-stellar 
mode orientation). Because the operating fre-quency of Vega 1 and Venera 16 were identical, 
the command activated Venera 16™s search for an 
appropriate star to orient itself. The process unfor-tunately exhausted all the remaining propellant on Venera 16 and controllers lost contact. Because it 
had already fulfilled its primary mission, control
-lers did not consider this a great loss. In 1988, the 
Main Directorate of Geodesy and Cartography published a full album entitled ﬁAtlas of Venusﬂ 
(Atlasa venery) of annotated images generated by the Venera 14 and 15 missions. A 2013 article in 
a Russian journal claimed that these two orbital 
missionsŠVenera 15 and 16Šwere the ﬁmost 
successful [missions] in the history of automated spaceflight in the 1970sŒ1980s.ﬂ161

after the combination of Venera and Galley, the 
Russian words for ﬁVenusﬂ and ﬁHalley,ﬂ was per
-haps the most ambitious deep space Soviet mis-sion to date. The mission had three major goals: to place advanced lander modules on the surface of Venus, to deploy balloons (two each) in the Venu
-sian atmosphere, and by using Venusian gravity, to 
fly the remaining buses past the Comet Halley. The 
entire mission was a cooperative effort between the Soviet Union (who provided the spacecraft and launch vehicle) with contributions from Austria, 
Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic 
Republic (East Germany), Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
France (whose contribution was significant), and 
the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). 
In addition, one instrument, a comet dust (flux) analyzer, was provided by an American cosmic ray 
physicist, John A. Simpson (1916Œ2000), at the 
University of Chicago. This instrument turned out to be the only American instrument that directly 
162
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
studied Halley™s comet during its 1986 encounter. 
While the landers were similar to ones used before for exploring Venus, the balloon gondolas were 
completely new Soviet-made vehicles that carried U.S.-French nephelometers to measure aerosol 
distribution in the atmosphere. The cometary flyby probes, which contained a 120-kilogram scien-tific package, were protected against high-veloc
-ity impacts from dust particles. After a successful 
flight to Venus, Vega 1 released its 1,500-kilogram 
descent module on 9 June 1985, two days before atmospheric entry. As the lander descended, at 
61 kilometers altitude, it released the first heli
-um-inflated plastic balloon with a hanging gondola underneath it. Mass was around 20.8 kilograms. As the balloon drifted through the Venusian atmo
-sphere (controlled partly by ballast), it transmitted important data on the atmosphere back to a net-work of tracking antennas on Earth. Balloon 1 sur-vived for 46.5 hours, eventually succumbing due to battery failure, having traversed about 11,600 kilometers. The lander set down safely on the ground at 03:02:54 UT on 11 June 1985 at 8.1° N˜/ 
176.7° longitude on the night side of Venus in the 
Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite and transmit
-ted from the surface for 56 minutes. Temperature 
and pressure at the landing site were 467°C and 93.88 atmospheres, respectively. The soil sample 
drill failed to complete its soil analysis, having spu-riously deployed about 15 minutes before reaching the surface, but the mass spectrometer returned 
important data. The Vega 1 bus flew by Venus at 
a range of 39,000 kilometers and then headed for its encounter with Halley. After course corrections 
on 25 June 1985 and 10 February 1986, the space
-craft began its formal studies of the comet on 4 March when it was 14 million kilometers from its target. During the 3-hour encounter on 6 March 
1986, the spacecraft approached to within 8,889 kilometers (at 07:20:06 UT) of Halley. Vega 1 took 
more than 500 pictures via different filters as it flew through the gas cloud around the coma. Although 
the spacecraft was battered by dust, none of the instruments were disabled during the encounter. 
Vega 1 collected a wealth of information on Halley 
including data on its nucleus, its dust production rate, its chemical composition, and its rotational 
rate. After subsequent imaging sessions on 7 and 
8 March 1986, Vega 1 headed out to heliocentric 
orbit where it continued to transmit data from at least some of its instruments until last contact on 30 January˜1987.167

and essentially performed a near-identical mission 
to its twin. The main lander probe set down with
-out problems at 03:00:50 UT on 15 June 1985 in the northern region of Aphrodite, about 1,500 
kilometers south-east of Vega. Landing coordinates 
were 7.2° S / 179.4° longitude. Temperature and 
pressure were recorded as 462°C and 87.11 atmo-spheres, respectively. The spacecraft transmitted 
from the surface for 57 minutes. Unlike its twin, the Vega 2 lander was able to collect and inves
-tigate a soil sample; the experiment identified an anorthosite-troctolite rock, rarely found on Earth, but present in the lunar highlands. According to 
the lander™s data, the area was probably the oldest 
explored by any Venera vehicle. The mass spectrom
-eter did not return any data. The balloon, released upon entry into the atmosphere, flew through the Venusian atmosphere, collecting data like its twin 
and survived for 46.5 hours of data transmission, traveling a slightly longer distance than its com-patriot from Vega 1. Neither balloon on Vega 1 
nor Vega 2 detected any lightning in the Venusian 
atmosphere. After releasing its lander, the flyby 
probe continued on its flight to Comet Halley. The 
spacecraft initiated its encounter on 7 March 1986 
by taking 100 photos of the comet from a distance of 14 million kilometers. Vega 2™s closest approach 
(8,030 kilometers) to Halley was at 07:20 UT two days later when the spacecraft was traveling at a velocity of 76.8 kilometers/second (slightly lower than Vega 1™s 79.2 kilometers/second). During the 
encounter, Vega 2 took 700 images of the comet of 
much better resolution than those from its twin, partly due to the presence of less dust outside of the coma during this transit, although many of the images were overexposed due to a failure in the primary pointing software. Ironically, Vega 2 sus
-tained an 80% power loss during the encounter (as compared to Vega 1™s 40%). Seven instruments 
between the two spacecraft were partially dam
-aged, although no instrument on both were inca-pacitated. After further imaging sessions on 10 and 
11 March 1986, Vega 2 finished its primary mission 
and headed out into heliocentric orbit. Like Vega 1, 
Vega 2 continued ﬁa series of scientific investiga
-tionsﬂ until last contact on 24 March 1987.165

Launch Date and Time:
 7 January 1985 / 19:26 UT
Launch Site: Kagoshima / Launch Complex M1
Scientific Instruments:1. solar wind ion detector2. plasma wave probe3. 2 magnetometersResults: The MS-T5 spacecraft, named Sakigake 
(ﬁpathfinderﬂ) after launch, was the first deep 
space spacecraft launched by any other country 
apart from the Soviet Union or the United States 
(Two German Helios probes had been launched by 
NASA). Japan™s goal had been to launch a single 
modest probe to fly past Comet Halley as part of 
a test to prove out the technologies and mission 
operations of the actual mission. Japan™s Insti
-tute of Space and Astronautical Sciences (ISAS) 
launched this test spacecraft, known as MS-T5, 
nearly identical to the ﬁactualﬂ spacecraft launched 
later. The spin-stabilized spacecraft was launched 
by a new Japanese launch vehicle, the Mu-3S-II. 
Following two course corrections on 10 January and 
14˜February 1985, Sakigake was sent on a long-
range encounter with Halley. The original distance 
to the comet was planned to be 3 million kilometers 
but was altered to a planned 7.6 million kilome-ters when the launch had to be delayed due to bad 
weather and problems with the launch vehicle. The 
spacecraft served as a reference vehicle to permit 
scientists to eliminate Earth atmospheric and ion-ospheric contributions to the variations in Giotto™s 
transmissions from within the coma. The space-craft™s closest approach to Halley was at 04:18 UT 
on 11 March 1986 when it was 6.99 million kilome-ters from the comet. Nearly six years after the Halley 
encounter, Sakigake performed a gravity assist by 
Earth on 8˜January 1992 at 88,790-kilometer range. 
After two more distant flybys through Earth™s tail 
(in June 1993 and July 1994), Sakigake maintained 
weekly contact with the ground until telemetry was 
lost on 15 November 1995. Earlier, Japanese sci
-entists had hoped to send the spacecraft on a flyby 
past Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner in 1998 but 
these were abandoned due to lack of sufficient pro-pellant. Although telemetry was lost, ground control 
continued to receive a beacon signal until 7 January 
1999, 14 years after launch.169

launched by the European Space Agency (ESA). It 
was named after famed Italian Renaissance painter Giotto di Bondone (c. 1267Œ1337) who had depicted Halley™s Comet as the Star of Bethlehem 
in his painting Adoration of the Magi. Because the 
cylindrical spacecraft was designed to approach closer to Halley than any other probe, it was equipped with two dust shields separated by 23 centimeters, the first to bear the shock of impact and spread the impact energy over larger areas of the second thicker rear sheet. The design of the space-craft was based on the spin-stabilized magneto-spheric Geos satellites launched in 1977 and 1978. After launch, and further course corrections on 26 August 1985, 12 February 1986, and 12 March 
1986, Giotto was put on a 500-kilometer-range 
flyby trajectory to the comet™s core. Ballistics data 
on its precise voyage was based upon tracking information from the Soviet Vega 1 and 2 probes. 
The Giotto spacecraft eventually passed by Halley on 14 March 1986. Closest encounter was at a distance of 596 kilometers at 00:03:02 UT, the 
spacecraft being the only one among the large armada of spacecraft sent to investigate Halley that actually entered the ionosphere of the comet. At 
a range of 137.6 million kilometers from Earth, just 2 seconds before closest approach, telemetry stopped due to impact with a heavy concentration of dust that probably knocked the spacecraft™s high 
gain antenna out of alignment with Earth. Fortu
-nately, data transmission was restored within 21.75 
seconds (with proper orientation of the antenna restored after 32 minutes). On average, Giotto had been hit 100 times a second by particles weighing up to 0.001 grams. By the end of its encounter with 
Halley, the spacecraft was covered in at least 26 
kilograms of dust stemming from 12,000 impacts. Giotto returned 2,000 images of Halley. After the 
encounter, ESA decided to redirect the vehicle for 
a flyby of Earth. The spacecraft was officially put in hibernation mode on 2 April 1986. Course cor
-rections on 10, 20, and 21 March 1986, however, 
set it on a 22,000-kilometer flyby of Earth on 2 July 1990 for a gravity assist (the first time that Earth had been used for such a purpose) to visit a new 
target: Comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup, which Giotto flew by at 15:30 UT on 10 July 1992 at range of approximately 200 kilometers. Eight experiments provided extensive data on a wide variety of com-etary phenomena during this closest ever flyby of a comet. After formal conclusion of the encoun
-ter, Giotto was put in hibernation on 23 July 1992. 
Later, in September 1999, ESA scientists revealed 
that a second comet or cometary fragment may have been accompanying Grigg-Skjellerup during the encounter in 1992. The spacecraft repeated a flyby of Earth at 02:40 UT on 1 July 1999 at range of 219,000 kilometers but was not reactivated.170

Scientific Instruments:1. ultraviolet imaging system2. electrostatic analyzerResults: Planet-A, named Suisei (ﬁcometﬂ) after launch, was the second of two Japanese probes 
launched towards Halley during the 1986 Earth 
encounter. The cylindrical spacecraft was launched 
directly on a deep space trajectory without entering 
167
1985
 intermediate Earth orbit. The main payload of the spacecraft was an ultraviolet-based imaging system that could study the huge hydrogen corona around the comet. After a course correction on 
14˜November 1985, Suisei flew within 152,400 
kilometers of the comet™s nucleus on 8 March 1986 
at 13:06 UT, returning ultraviolet images of the 20 
million-kilometer diameter hydrogen gas coma. Even at that relatively large distance from the comet, the spacecraft was hit by at least two dust particles, each 1 millimeter in diameter. After the 
Halley encounter, in 1987, ISAS decided to send 
the spacecraft through an elaborate trajectory for an encounter with Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner on 
24 November 1998, 13 years after launch. Suisei performed a series of trajectory corrections on 
5Œ10 April 1987 to send it on a gravity assist around 
Earth on 20 August 1992 at a range of 60,000 kilo
-meters. Unfortunately, hydrazine for further cor

mission to Mars and its 27-kilometer diameter moon Phobos that culminated a decade-long pro-gram of development. A truly multinational proj
-ect that was the last hurrah for Soviet planetary exploration, the missions involved contributions 
from 14 other nations including Austria, Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, Finland, France (undoubtedly 
the most active partner), East Germany, West 
Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Switzerland, 
Sweden, and the European Space Agency. NASA 
provided some tracking support through its Deep Space Network. Each spacecraft, with a newly designed standardized bus known as the UMVL, comprised a Mars orbiter for long-term studies of the planet and a 67-kilogram Long-Term Autono
-mous Station (DAS) which would land on Phobos, 
anchored by a harpoon driven into the soil, to study 170
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
its geological and climactic conditions. The core 
of the bus was an autonomous engine unit (using the S5.92 engine, later named Fregat) that essen
-tially acted as the fifth stage of the Proton launch vehicle, boosting the spacecraft to Mars from a 
highly eccentric Earth orbit attained after a firing of the Blok D upper stage. After each spacecraft 
entered orbit around Mars, they were designed to make very close (c. 50 meters) flybys of Phobos (on 7˜April 1989 for Fobos 1), and sample surface 
material using two innovative methods (using a laser and using a beam of krypton ions) that would actively disturb the soil of Phobos. Instruments 
would then measure and evaluate the response. After the Phobos flyby, it was planned for the 
spacecraft to continue science missions directed at Mars from Martian orbit. The spacecraft were loaded with an unprecedented array of experi-ments, making them probably the most highly 
instrumented deep space mission ever launched. Fobos 1 performed a course correction en route to 
Mars on 16 July 1988. On 29 August 1988, instead 
of a routine command to switch on the GS-14STsF gamma-emission spectrometer, an erroneous com
-mand was issued as a result of a programming error, 
to turn off the orientation and stabilization system. As a result, the spacecraft lost proper solar orienta-tion, i.e., the solar panels faced away from the Sun and thus began to lose power. There was no word 
from Fobos 1 at the next scheduled communica
-tions session on 2 September. Continuing attempts 
to establish contact failed, and on 3 November 1988, the Soviets officially announced that there would be no further attempts at contact. The engi
-neer who sent the false command was apparently barred from working on the shift teams for Fobos 2. 
Fobos 1 meanwhile flew by Mars without entering 
orbit (scheduled for 23 January 1989) and even-tually entered heliocentric orbit. The most signif-icant scientific data from the mission came from the Terek solar telescope, which returned import
-ant information on some of the then-least studied 
layers of the solar atmosphere, the chromosphere, the corona, and the transition layer.

Fobos 1, to orbit Mars and fly past Phobos (on 
13 June 1989) but had an additional payload, a small 43-kilogram instrumented ﬁhopperﬂ known as PrOP-FP that would make 20-meter jumps across the surface of Phobos for about 4 hours. The orbiter also had a slightly different instru-ment complementŠit did not carry the IPNM, 
Plazma, and Terek instruments carried on Fobos 1. 
PrOP-FP (Device to Evaluate MobilityŠPhobos) had its own power supply system, radio transmitter, 
and a suite of scientific instruments. This ﬁroverﬂ was designed to perform hops ranging from 10 to 40 meters and take data measurements after each hop. Despite some onboard anomalies, Fobos 2 
carried out two en route course corrections on 21˜July 1988 and 23 January 1989. One of the 
two radio transmitters failed, while its Buk com-puter was acting erratically due to faulty capacitors in the computer™s power supply, a fact that was 
known before launch. At 12:55 UT on 29 January 
1989, the spacecraft fired its engine to enter orbit 
around Mars. Initial orbital parameters were 819 × 81,214 kilometers at 1.5° inclination. In the initial months in orbit around Mars, the spacecraft con
-ducted substantive investigations of the Red Planet and also photographed areas of its surface. During this period, controllers implemented four further 
orbital corrections in order to put its trajectory on an encounter course with Phobos. The spacecraft also jettisoned its Fregat upper stage (which had 
fired its engine to enter Mars orbit). Fobos 2 took 
high resolution photos of the moon on 23 February 
(at 860 kilometers range), 28 February (320 kilo
-meters), and 25˜March 1989 (191 kilometers), 
covering about 80% of its surface. Release of its 
lander was scheduled for 4Œ5 April 1989, but on 
27 March during a regularly planned communica-tions session at 15:58˜UT, there was no word from 
the spacecraft. A weak signal was received between 
17:51 and 18:03˜UT, but there was no telemetry 
information. The nature of the signal indicated that the spacecraft had lost all orientation and was spin-ning. Future attempts to regain communication 
were unsuccessful and the mission was declared lost on 14 April 1989. The most probable cause 
was failure of the power supply for the Buk com
-puter, something that had actually happened ear
-lier in the mission (on 21˜January 1989). On this 
occasion, controllers failed to revive the vehicle. Roald Sagdeev (1932Œ ), the director of the Insti-tute of Space Research noted in the journal Priroda (Nature) in mid-1989 that ﬁI think we should seek the cause of the failure in the very organization of the project, in its planningﬂ adding that ﬁthe relationships between the customer [the science community] and contractor [Lavochkin] – are clearly˜abnormal.ﬂ173

Launch Date and Time:
 4 May 1989 / 18:47:00 UT
Launch Site: Kennedy Space Center / Launch 
Complex 39B
Scientific Instruments:1. synthetic aperture radar (RDRS)Results: Magellan, named after the Portuguese 
explorer Ferdinand Magellan (1480Œ1521), was 
the first deep space probe launched by the United States in almost 11 years, and also the first launched by the Space Shuttle. The Challenger disaster in January 1986 profoundly impacted the Shuttle launch manifest into the 1990s, which included a number of planetary missions. Magellan, for exam-ple, was delayed by at least a year. The spacecraft 
was designed to use a Synthetic Aperture Radar 
(SAR) to map 70% of the Venusian surface down to 
a resolution of 120Œ300 meters. The basic bus was assembled using spare parts left over from various prior missions including Voyager, Galileo, Ulysses, 
and Mariner 9. Magellan was deployed by the STS-30R crew and released at 01:01 UT on 5 May 1989 from Atlantis™ payload bay. One hour later, a 
two-stage Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) fired to send the spacecraft on a trajectory to rendezvous with Venus. After three en route trajectory corrections 
(the first two on 21 May 1989, 13 March 1990, 
and 25 July 1990), Magellan arrived in Venus orbit 
on 10 August 1990. Orbital parameters were 297 
× 8,463 kilometers at 85.5° inclination. Six days after entering orbit, Magellan suffered a communi-cations outage lasting 15 hours. After a second 17 
hour-interruption on 21 August, the ground sent 
up new preventative software to reset the system in case of such anomalies. Beginning 15 September 1990, the spacecraft began returning high-quality radar images of the Venusian terrain that showed 
evidence of volcanism, tectonic movement, turbu-lent surface winds, kilometers of lava channels, and pancake-shaped domes. Magellan completed its first 243-day cycle (i.e., the time it took for Venus 
to rotate once under Magellan™s orbit) of radar map
-ping on 15 May 1991, providing the first clear views of 83.7% of the surface. The spacecraft returned 1,200 Gbits of data, far exceeding the 900 Gbits 
of data from all NASA planetary missions com-bined at the time. The spacecraft™s second mapping 
cycle, already beyond the original goals of the mis
-sion, ended on 15 January 1992, raising coverage to 96%. A third cycle that focused on stereo imaging 
ended on 13 September 1992, finished coverage at 98%. Further cyclesŠa fourth (ending on 23 May 1993), a fifth (ending on 29˜August 1994), 
and a sixth (ending on 13˜October 1994)Šfocused 
on obtaining gravimetric data on the planet. In the summer of 1993, controllers commanded the spacecraft to drop into the outermost regions of the Venusian atmosphere and then successfully 
used an aerobraking method to circularize its orbit. Contact was lost after 10:05 UT on 13˜October 
1994 as the spacecraft was commanded to plunge into the atmosphere to gather aerodynamic data. The spacecraft burned up in the Venusian atmo
-sphere about 10 hours later after one of the most successful deep space missions. Magellan found that at least 85% of the Venusian surface is covered 
174

with volcanic flows. The spacecraft™s data sug
-gested that despite the high surface temperatures 
(475°C) and high atmospheric pressures (92 atmo-spheres), the complete lack of water makes ero-sion an extremely slow process on the planet. As a 

result, surface features can persist for hundreds of 
millions of years. In addition, the spacecraft found 

that such phenomena as continental drift are not 

evident on the planet. Its imagery contributed to 
the best high-resolution radar maps of Venus™ sur
-face to date, improving on the images returned by 
the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 in the 1980s.
This simulated color global view of the surface of Venus taken by Magellan is centered at 180
°E longitude. Data gaps in 
Magellan™s data were ˜lled in by information from Pioneer Venus. Most notably, the simulated hues are based on color 
images from the Soviet Venera 13 and Venera 14 spacecraft.

deep space exploration projects, was the result of plans dating back to the early 1980s to deploy a Jupiter orbiter and probe. In its final configuration, the orbiter was a 4.6-meter tall spacecraft designed to operate for 22 months in Jovian orbit using 10 instruments/experiments to study the planet™s 
atmosphere, satellites, and magnetosphere. Galileo, named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564Œ1642), carried a 337-kilogram probe designed to return data as it entered the Jovian 
atmosphere (by parachute) to identify atmospheric 
materials and conditions that cannot be detected from outside. Because of limitations of a Space Shuttle/IUS combination, NASA decided to use a complex multiple gravity assist scheme that 
required three flybys (two of Earth and one of 
Venus) on its way to Jupiter. The STS-34R crew 
released the spacecraft 6.5 hours after launch; an hour later, the two-stage IUS fired to send Galileo 
on its way. Galileo flew past Venus at 05:58:48 UT 
on 10 February 1990 at a range of 16,106 kilome
-ters during which it conducted an extensive survey of the planet (including imaging). Having gained 8,030 kilometers/hour in velocity, the spacecraft 
flew by Earth twice, the first time at 960 kilometers range at 20:34:34 UT on 8 December 1990 when it 
detected chemical signatures associated with life-form activity in atmospheric trace elements on our 
home planet. The spacecraft also conducted lunar observations. A major problem occurred on 11˜April 
1991 when the high-gain antenna failed to fully deploy, thus eliminating the possibility of data 
transmission during its flyby of the asteroid 951 Gaspra. A low-gain antenna was instead used for 
the remainder of the mission, augmented by inge-nious strategies including the use of data compres-sion software that allowed a higher data throughput than was originally possible with the low-gain antenna. Becoming the first human-made object to 
fly past an asteroid, Galileo approached the minor planet Gaspra to a distance of 1,604 kilometers at 22:37 UT on 29 October 1991. The encounter pro-vided much data including 150 images of the aster
-oid. Galileo then sped to its second encounter with 
the EarthŒMoon system, with a flyby of Earth at 
303.1 kilometers at 15:09:25 UT on 8 December 1992, adding 3.7 kilometers/second to its cumula-tive velocity. Galileo flew by a second asteroid, 243 
Ida, at 16:51:59 UT on 28 August 1993 at a range 
of 2,410 kilometers, providing further data on minor planets. Later in July 1994, as it was speed-ing towards Jupiter, Galileo provided astronomers™ 
only direct observations of Comet D/1993 F2 176
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Shoemaker-Levy 9™s impact into the Jovian atmo
-sphere. Galileo™s atmospheric entry probe, based 
on the design of the large probe of the Pioneer 
Venus multiprobe, was finally released on 13 July 
1995 when the spacecraft was still 80 million kilo-meters from Jupiter. The probe hit the atmosphere 
at 6.5° N / 4.4° W at 22:04:44 UT on 7 December 1995, traveling at a relative velocity of 48 kilome
-ters/hour, and returned valuable data for 58 min
-utes as it plunged into the Jovian cauldron. The entry probe endured a maximum deceleration of 228 g™s about a minute after entry when tempera
-tures scaled up to 16,000°C. The probe™s transmit
-ter failed 61.4 minutes after entry when the spacecraft was 180 kilometers below its entry ceil-ing, evidently due to the enormous pressure (22.7 atmospheres). Data, originally transmitted to its parent and then later transmitted back to Earth, indicated an intense radiation belt 50,000 kilome-ters above Jupiter™s clouds, few organic compounds, 
and winds as high as 640 meters/second. The entry probe also found less lightning, less water vapor, 
and half the helium than had been expected in the upper atmosphere. The Galileo orbiter, meanwhile, 
fired its engine at 00:27 UT on 8 December, 
becoming Jupiter™s first human-made satellite. Its 
orbital period was 198 days. Soon after, Galileo 
began its planned 11 tours over 22 months explor
-ing the planet and its moons, including flybys of Ganymede (for the first time on 27 June 1996) and Europa (on 6 November 1997). Having fulfilled its original goals, NASA implemented a two-year extension to 31 December 1999 with the Galileo 
Europa Mission (GEM) during which the space-craft conducted numerous flybys of Jupiter™s 
moons, each encounter yielding a wealth of scien-tific data. These included flybys of Europa nine times (eight between December 1997 and February 
1999 and once in January 2000), Callisto four times (between May 1999 and September 1999), and Io three times (in October 1999, November 1999, and February 2000). On the last flyby of Io, 
Galileo flew only 198 kilometers from the surface of Io sending back the highest resolution photos 
yet of the volcanically active moon. On 8 March 2000, NASA announced plans to extend Galileo™s 
mission again, with a new phase beginning October 2000 called the Galileo Millennium Mission. The idea was to coordinate investigations of Jupiter and its environsŠparticular the interaction of the solar wind with the planet™s magnetosphereŠwith the 
Cassini spacecraft (on its way to Saturn) that was 
expected to fly past Jupiter in December 2000. 
This second extension was largely possible due to the extreme accuracy of navigation during the prior phases of the mission that had saved a significant amount of maneuvering propellant. The RTGs on board the spacecraft were still delivering about 450˜W in 2000, although power capacity was 
declining at a rate of about 7 W per year. Under the 
Millennium Mission, Galileo flew by Ganymede, 
the largest moon in the solar system, on 20 May at a range of 809 kilometers and made its final flyby (also of Ganymede) on 28 December 2000 at a range of 2,337 kilometers. In January 2001, both 
Galileo and Cassini together encountered the mag-netosphere bow shock within a half hour of each other. As the mission entered its final phase, mis
-sion scientists arranged for three final flybys of Io, primarily to obtain more data on the moon™s mag
-netic field and heat generation that drives its volca-nism. A final flyby of Callisto (in May 2001) 
resulted in some very high-resolution photographs and led to the Io encounters in August and October 
2001 and in January 2002, the last one at a stagger-ing 101.5 kilometers range, the closest it had gotten to any moon in its entire mission. This close 
encounter increased Galileo™s orbit such that it 
could be easily commanded in the future to termi-nate its mission in Jupiter™s atmosphere. A flyby of 
Amalthea in November 2002 provided key infor-mation on the moon™s density and preceded its 
closest flyby of Jupiter itself. Beginning March 2003, Galileo was contacted once a week only to verify its status. Many years of operation in the Jovian system had exposed the spacecraft to intense radiation, taking a toll on many systems and instru-ments. Because Galileo had not been sterilized, to 177
1989
 prevent contamination, it was decided to have the 
vehicle burn up in the Jovian atmosphere instead of risking impact on a moon such as Europa. 
Having completed its 35th orbit around Jupiter and after accompanying the planet for three-quarters of 
a circuit around the Sun, Galileo flew into the atmosphere at a velocity of 48.2 kilometers/second, just south of equator, on 21 September 2003 at 
18:57 UT. In its nearly eight-year mission around 
Jupiter, Galileo had returned an unprecedented 
amount of data on the planet and its environs. For 
example, Galileo discovered far less lightning activ-ity (about 10% of that found in an equal area on 
Earth) than anticipated, helium abundance in 
Jupiter very nearly the same as in the Sun (24% compared to 25%), extensive resurfacing of Io™s 
surface due to continuing volcanic activity since the Voyagers flew by in 1979, and evidence for 
liquid water ocean under Europa™s icy surface (with 
indications of similar liquid saltwater layers under the surfaces of Ganymede and Callisto). Jupiter™s 
ring system was found to be made of dust from impacts on the four small inner moons. Galileo also discovered materials linked to organic compounds 
(clay-like minerals known as phyllosilicates) on the 
icy crust of Europa, perhaps produced by collisions with an asteroid or a comet. The spacecraft also identified the first internal magnetic field of a moon (Ganymede) that produces a ﬁmini- magnetosphereﬂ within Jupiter™s larger magneto
-sphere. By March 2000, the spacecraft had returned about 14,000 images back to˜Earth.179

Launch Date and Time:
 24 January 1990 / 11:46:00 UT
Launch Site: Kagoshima / Launch Complex M1
Scientific Instruments:Hiten:1. cosmic dust detector (MDC)Results: This two-module Japanese spacecraft was designed to fly past the Moon and release an orbiter. It was the first Japanese lunar mission and 
also the first robotic lunar probe since the flight of the Soviet Luna 24 in 1976. MUSES-A (for Mu-launched Space Engineering Satellite), named Hiten (ﬁmusical angelﬂ) after launch, was put into a highly elliptical orbit around Earth that intersected with the Moon™s orbit. Due to a problem with the 
orbital injection burn, the probe™s orbital apogee 
was 290,000 kilometers, much less than the hoped for 476,000 kilometers, but after a number of sub-sequent maneuvers, Hiten reached its originally planned nominal orbit. At 19:37 UT on 18 March, 
during its first flyby of the Moon, Hiten released 
into lunar orbit, a small 12-kilogram ﬁgrandchildﬂ 
satellite named Hagoromo. Hagoromo did not carry any science instruments and was designed to only transmit telemetry and diagnostic data back to Earth, but it made Japan the first nation 
besides the Soviet Union and the United States to put a spacecraft into lunar orbit. Hagoromo™s 
initial orbital parameters were 20,000 × 7,400 kilometers. Although the maneuver successfully 
demonstrated the use of the swingby technique to enter lunar orbit, communications with Hagoromo had already been lost shortly before release on 21˜February when its S-band transmitter failed. 
Hiten, meanwhile, passed by the Moon at 20:04:09 UT on 18 March at a distance of 16,472.4 kilo-meters and continued on its trajectory, simu
-lating the orbital path of the proposed Geotail spacecraft. By 4 March 1991, Hiten had carried out seven more lunar flybys and began a phase of aerobraking into Earth™s atmosphereŠa feat it 
carried out for the first time by any spacecraft on 19 March (at 00:43 UT) at an altitude of 125.5 kilometers, which lowered Hiten™s relative velocity 
by 1.712 meters/second and its orbital apogee by 8,665 kilometers. A second aerobraking over Earth 
occurred at 11:36˜UT on 30˜March at 120 kilome
-ters altitude, reducing velocity by 2.8 kilometers/second and apogee by another 14,000 kilometers. With its primary mission now over, Hiten began 
an unexpected extended mission to experiment 
with a novel method to enter lunar orbit. After a 
ninth and tenth flyby of the Moon, the latter on 2 October 1991, Hiten was put into a looping orbit that passed the EarthŒMoon L4 and L5 Lagrange Points in October 1991 and January 1991, respec
-tively, where it activated its MDC cosmic dust 
detector, jointly built with Germany. Circling back 
to the Moon for its eleventh flyby of the Moon at 
13:33 UT on 15 February 1992 at a range of 422 
kilometers, Hiten used a portion of its last remain-ing propellant to fire its engine (for 10 minutes) and insert itself into lunar orbit. This profile to enter lunar orbit that required very little delta-V on the part of the spacecraft was developed by JPL 180

mathematician Edward Belbruno (1951Œ ). Initial 
orbital parameters around the Moon were 422 × 49,400 kilometers. A final amount of propellant 
was then used two months later, on 10 April 1993 
to deorbit Hiten, which crashed onto the lunar sur-face at 18:03:25.7 UT at 55.3° E / 34.0° S.176

(ISPM) that originally involved two spacecraftŠone American and one EuropeanŠflying over 
opposite solar poles to investigate the Sun in three dimensions. Eventually, NASA cancelled its 
spacecraft, significantly eroding the confidence of international partners in the reliability of NASA as a partner, and the mission merged into a single 
spacecraft, provided by ESA. The scientific payload was shared by ESA and NASA, with the latter pro-viding the RTG power source (similar to one used on Galileo), a Space Shuttle launch, and tracking from its Deep Space Network. Ground control operations were shared by both the Americans 
and Europeans. The vehicle was designed to fly a unique trajectory that would use a gravity assist from Jupiter to take it below the ecliptic plane and pass the solar south pole and then above the eclip-tic to fly over the north pole. Eventually, 13 years 
after ESA™s science council had approved the mis
-sion, and considerably delayed by the Challenger disaster, on 6 October 1990, about 7.5 hours after 
launch, Ulysses was sent on its way into helio-centric orbit via an Inertial Upper Stage/PAM-S 
motor combination. Escape velocity was 15.4 kilo-meters/second, higher than had been achieved by either of the Voyagers or Pioneers, and the fastest 
velocity ever achieved by a human-made object at the time. After a mid-course correction on 8 July 
1991, Ulysses passed within 378,400 kilometers of Jupiter at 12:02 UT on 8 February 1992, becom
-ing the fifth spacecraft to reach Jupiter. After a 
17-day period passing through and studying the Jovian system, the spacecraft headed downwards and back to the Sun. From about mid-1993 on, 
Ulysses was constantly in the region of space dom-inated by the Sun™s southern pole, as indicated by 
the constant negative polarity measured by the magnetometer. South polar observations extended 
from 26˜June to 6 November 1994, when the vehi
-cle was above 70° solar latitude. It reached a max-imum of 80.2° in September 1994. Its instruments found that the solar wind blows faster at the south 
pole than at the equatorial regions. Flying up above the solar equator on 5 March 1995, Ulysses passed over the north polar regions between 19 June and 30 September 1995 (maximum latitude of 80.2°). Closest approach to the Sun was on 12 March 1995 at a range of 200 million kilometers. ESA officially extended Ulysses™ mission on 1 October 
1995, renaming this portion as the Second Solar 181
1990
 Orbit. Three times during its mission, the space-craft unexpectedly passed through comet tailsŠthe first time in May 1996 (Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake), the second time in 1999 (Comet C/1999 T1 McNaught-Hartley), and the third time in 2007 (Comet C/2006 P1 McNaught). The spacecraft made a second pass over the solar south pole between September 2000 and January 2001 
and the northern pole between September and December 2001. At the time, the Sun was at the 
peak of its 11-year cycle; Ulysses found that the 
southern magnetic pole was much more dynamic 
than the north pole and lacked any fixed clear loca-tion. ESA™s Science Program Committee, during 
a meeting on 5Œ6 June 2000, agreed to extend the Ulysses mission from the end of 2001 to 30 September 2004. In 2003Œ2004, Ulysses spun out towards its aphelion (furthest point in its orbit) and 
made distant observations of Jupiter. ESA™s Science 
Program Committee approved a fourth extension of the Ulysses mission so that it could continue investigations over the Sun™s poles in 2007 and 
2008. In early 2008, ESA and NASA announced that the mission would finally terminate within 
the subsequent few months, having operated more than four times its design life. With communica
-tions systems failing as well as power depleting due to the decline of the RTGs (and thus allowing the hydrazine fuel in its attitude control system to freeze), the spacecraft was on its last breath at that point. Mission operations continued at reduced capacity until loss of contact on 30 June 2009, more than 18.5 years after launch. Ulysses™ princi
-pal findings include data that showed that there is a weakening of the solar wind over time (which was at a 50-year low in 2008), that the solar magnetic field at the poles is much weaker than previously 
assumed, that the Sun™s magnetic field ﬁreversesﬂ 
in direction every 11 years, and that small dust particles coming in from deep space into the solar 
system are 30 times more abundant than previ-ously assumed.183

of Japan™s ISAS (and later, from 2003, JAXA), 
and NASA, executed as part of the International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) project, which 
also included the later Wind, Polar, SOHO, and 
Cluster missions. This particular mission™s goal was 
to study the structure and dynamics of the long tail region of Earth™s magnetosphere, which is created 
on the nightside of Earth by the solar wind. During active periods, the tail couples with the near-Earth 
magnetosphere, and often releases energy that is stored in the tail, thus activating auroras in the polar ionosphere. Although technically not a deep 
space or planetary mission, Geotail, in its extremely elliptical orbit, performed numerous lunar flybys, some closer than the distance at which the Soviet Luna 3 took the first pictures of the farside of the Moon. The spin-stabilized spacecraft (20 rpms) was designed with a pair of 100-meter tip-to-tip antennae and two 6-meter-long masts. On its fifth 
orbit around Earth, near apogee, on 8 September 1992, the spacecraft flew by the Moon at a range of 12,647 kilometers. The flyby raised apogee from 426,756 kilometers to 869,170 kilometers. 
Such flybys continued almost every month sub-sequent to that, and ultimately raised the space-craft™s apogee to 1.4 million kilometers. During 
these orbits, Geotail observed the magnetotail™s far 
region (from 80 to 220 times the radius of Earth or ﬁReﬂ). Geotail™s 14th and last flyby of the Moon 
occurred on 25˜October 1994 at a range of 22,445 
kilometers and as a result, placed the spacecraft in orbits with progressively lower apogees. In November 1994, Geotail™s apogee was 50 Re and 
by February 1995, it was down to 30 Re. The lower 
orbit was designed to allow the spacecraft to begin the second part of its mission, to study magnetotail sub-storms near Earth. During these orbits, peri-gee was about 10 Re, while the orbital inclination to the ecliptic plane was about Œ7° in order that the apogee would be located in the magnetotail™s 
neutral plane during the winter solstice. Later in the decade, Geotail™s orbit was adjusted so that it 
passed just inside Earth™s magnetosphere™s bound
-ary plane on the dayside. In 2012, the spacecraft celebrated twenty years of continuous operation, and in 2014, despite having an original lifetime of only four years, was still sending back data on 
the formation of auroras, the nature of energy fun-neled from the Sun into near-Earth space, and the 
ways in which Earth™s magnetic field lines move 
and rebound, thus producing explosive bursts that affect our magnetic environment.184

Mars balloon relay receiver (MBR)Results: Mars Observer was designed to carry out 
a high-resolution photography mission of the Red 
Planet over the course of a Martian year (687 days) 
from a 378 × 350-kilometer polar orbit. Building 
on the research done by the Viking missions, it car
-ried a suite of instruments to investigate Martian 
geology, atmosphere, and climate in order to fill in 
gaps on our knowledge of planetary evolution. A 
mere 31 minutes after launch, the new Transfer 
Orbit Stage (TOS), using the Orbus 21 solid rocket 
motor, fired to boost the spacecraft on an encounter 
trajectory with Mars. After a 725 million-kilome
-ter voyage lasting 11 months, at 00:40 UT on 22 
August 1993, just two days prior to planned entry 
into Mars orbit, the spacecraft stopped sending 
telemetry (as planned), but then never resumed 
14 minutes later. Despite vigorous efforts to regain 
contact, Mars Observer remained quiet. When the 
spacecraft did not reestablish command as a result 
of a stored program that was designed to do in case 
of five days of silence, mission planners finally gave 
up hope on salvaging the mission. The results of 
a five-month investigation proved to be inconclu-sive, but one likely cause of the catastrophic failure 
may have been a fuel line rupture that could have 
damaged the spacecraft™s electronics, throwing the 
vehicle into a spin. In addition, the fact that the 
Mars Observer bus was a repurposed Earth science 
satellite bus may have also compromised the space-craft™s ability to adapt to the deep space environ
-ment. While none of the primary mission objectives 
were accomplished, the spacecraft did return data 
during its interplanetary cruise. Scientific instru-ments developed for Mars Observer were later used 
on several subsequent Mars probes, including Mars 
Global Surveyor (launched in 1996), Mars Climate 
Orbiter (1998), Mars Odyssey (2001), and Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter (2005).185

S-band transponder Doppler gravity experiment9. charged particle telescope (CPT)Results: Clementine was the first U.S. spacecraft launched to the Moon in over 20 years (since Explorer 49 in June 1973). The spacecraft, also 
known as the Deep Space Program Science Exper-iment (DSPSE), was designed and built to demon-strate a set of lightweight technologies such as 
small-imaging sensors and lightweight gallium arsenide solar panels for future low-cost missions flown by the Department of Defense. Specifically, 
Clementine was a technology proving mission for 
the DOD™s Brilliant Pebbles program for the Strate
-gic Defense Initiative (SDI), which required a large 
fleet of inexpensive spacecraft. Clementine carried 15 advanced flight-test components and 9 science instruments. After launch, the spacecraft remained 
in a temporary parking orbit until 3 February 1994, 
at which time a solid-propellant rocket ignited to send the vehicle to the Moon. After two subsequent 
Earth flybys on 5 and 15 February, on 19˜February 
Clementine successfully entered an elliptical polar orbit (430 × 2,950 kilometers) around the Moon with a period of five days. In the following two months, it transmitted about 1.6 million digital 
images of the lunar surface, many of them with resolutions down to 100Œ200 meters, in the pro-cess, providing scientists with their first look at the total lunar landscape including polar regions. After completing its mission goals over 297 orbits around lunar orbit, controllers fired Clementine™s 
thrusters on 3 May to inject it on a rendezvous trajectory (via an Earth flyby) with the asteroid 1620 Geographos in August 1994. However, due 
to a computer problem at 14:39 UT on 7 May that caused a thruster to fire and use up all propellant, the spacecraft was put in an uncontrollable tumble at about 80 rpms with no spin control. Controllers were forced to cancel the asteroid flyby and return 
the vehicle to the vicinity of Earth. A power supply 
problem further diminished the operating capacity of the vehicle. Eventually, on 20 July, lunar gravity 
took control of Clementine and propelled it into heliocentric orbit. The mission was terminated on 8˜August when falling power supply levels no 
longer allowed clear telemetry exchange. Surpris-ingly, because the spacecraft was fortuitously in 
the correct attitude to power up again, ground con-trollers were able to briefly regain contact between 20 February and 10 May 1995. On 3 December 
1996, the Department of Defense announced that Clementine data indicated that there was ice in the bottom of a permanently shadowed crater 186
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
on the lunar south pole. Scientists estimated the deposit to be approximately 60,000 to 120,000 cubic meters in volume, i.e., comparable to a small 
lake that is four football fields in surface area and 5 meters deep. This estimate was very uncertain, however, due to the nature of the data. An account
-ing of Clementine™s legacy should include the fact 
that methods developed for the project became the basis for NASA™s ﬁFaster, Better, Cheaperﬂ initiative 
which ultimately paved the way for the Agency™s

Konus gamma-ray burst studies experimentResults: Wind was part of the International Solar 
Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program, a joint proj
-ect between (principally) the United States, Japan, and the European Space Agency (although 
a few other countries such as Russia, the Czech Republic, and France made significant contribu
-tions) to study the behavior of the solar-terrestrial 
system. Participating spacecraft included Geotail, 
Wind, Polar, SOHO, and Cluster. The first of 
two NASA-sponsored Global Geospace Science (CGS) vehicles, the Wind spacecraft carried eight 
instruments (including the French WAVES and 
the Russian Konus) to investigate the solar wind™s 
encounters with Earth™s magnetosphere and ion
-osphere in order to determine the origins and 
three-dimensional characteristics of the solar wind. 
The spacecraft™s original mission was to directly 
move to the L1 Lagrange point but because the SOHO and ACE spacecraft were directed to that 
location, the WIND mission was reformulated to operate for some time in a unique figure-eight-shaped elliptical orbit around Earth at 28,000 × 1.6 million kilometers, partially maintained by periodic ﬁdouble flybysﬂ of the Moon. In this orbit, Wind was 
positioned so as to make use of lunar gravity assists to maintain its apogee over the day hemisphere of Earth and conduct magnetospheric observations. 
The closest of its 19 flybys of the Moon between 1 December 1994 and 17 November 1998 took place on 27˜December 1994 at a range of 11,834 
kilometers. Finally, by November 1996, Wind was 
in a ﬁhalo orbitﬂ around the SunŒEarth L1 libration point where solar and terrestrial gravity are approx-imately equal. Parameters varied between 235 and 
265 Earth radii. In this orbit, Wind measured the 
incoming solar wind, and magnetic fields and par-ticles on a continuous basis, providing about an hour warning to the other ISTP-related spacecraft on changes in the solar wind. On 17 November 1998, Wind began to move into a series of ﬁpetalﬂ 
orbits, designed to take it out of the ecliptic plane. 
Wind™s trips above and below the ecliptic (up to 
187
1994
 60°) allowed the spacecraft to sample regions of 
interplanetary space and the magnetosphere that 
had not been previously studied. By 2004, it was 
back at L1 where it has remained. The original 
projected lifetime of the vehicle was anticipated to 
be three to five years but WIND continues to be 
largely operational in 2017, 22 years after its launch, 
with one instrument, the TGRS gamma-ray spec-trometer turned off, and a couple of detectors on 
the EPACT instrument, non-functional. Current 
projections suggest that it will have enough fuel to 
remain at L1 for at least another 60 years. Despite 
the formal conclusion of the ISTP in December 
2001, Wind continues to play a supporting role 
for a variety of other spacecraft supporting solar 
research, including Polar, Cluster, Geotail, Image, 
SOHO, and˜ACE.189

Michelson Doppler imager/solar oscilla-tions investigation (MDI/SOI)Results: The ESA-sponsored Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) carries 12 scientific instru-ments to study the solar atmosphere, helioseis-mology, and the solar wind. Information from the 
mission has allowed scientists to learn more about the Sun™s internal structure and dynamics, the 
chromosphere, the corona, and solar particles. The 
SOHO and Cluster missions, part of ESA™s Solar 
Terrestrial Science Programme (STSP), are ESA™s 
contributions to the International Solar Terres
-trial Physics (ISTP) program, which has involved the work of other spacecraft such as Wind and 
ACE, which, like SOHO, operate in the vicinity of the SunŒEarth L1 point. NASA contributed three instruments on SOHO as well as launch and flight operations support. About two months after 
launch, on 14 February 1996, SOHO was placed at 
a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in an elliptical Lissajous orbit around the L1 libration point where it takes approximately six months to orbit L1 (while the L1 itself orbits the Sun every 12 months). The spacecraft returned its first image on 19 December 1995 and was fully commissioned for operations by 16 April 1996. SOHO finished its 
planned two-year study of the Sun™s atmosphere, 
surface, and interior in April 1998. Communica
-tions with the spacecraft were interrupted for four months beginning 24 June 1998, after which the spacecraft was apparently spinning, losing electri
-cal power, and not pointing at the Sun. After inten
-sive search efforts, by 25 September, controllers 
managed to regain control and return SOHO to ﬁnormal mode.ﬂ Because of the failure of onboard gyros, ESA developed a special gyroless method of orientation (which used reaction wheels) that was successfully implemented beginning 1 February 
1999. Barring three instruments, the spacecraft 190
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
was functional and was declared operational once 
again by mid-October 1998. SOHO™s original life
-time was three years (to 1998), but in 1997, ESA and NASA jointly decided to prolong the mission 
to 2003, thus enabling the spacecraft to compare the Sun™s behavior during low dark sunspot activity 
(1996) to the peak (around 2000). One of SOHO™s 
most important discoveries has been locating the origin of the fast solar wind at the corners of honey-comb-shaped magnetic fields surrounding the edges 
of large bubbling cells located near the Sun™s poles. 
Another has been its discovery, as of September 
2015, of over 3,000 comets (more than one-half of 
all known comets), by over 70 people representing 
18 different nations. These discoveries were made 
possible because of the LASCO instrument that 
while observing the Sun, blocked out the Sun™s 
glare, rendering comets visible. SOHO™s mission at 
L1 has now been extended six times, most recently 
in June 2013, to at least December 2016. In 
December 2015, SOHO marked 20 years of contin-uous operation, having fundamentally changed our 
conception of the Sun ﬁfrom a picture of a static, 
unchanging object in the sky to the dynamic beast 
it is,ﬂ in the words of Bernhard Fleck, the ESA proj-ect scientist for SOHO. The longevity of the mis-sion has allowed SOHO to cover an entire 11-year 
solar cycle and the beginning of a new one. One of 
the recent highpoints of the mission was SOHO™s 
observation of a bright comet plunging toward the 
Sun on 3Œ4 August 2016 at a velocity of nearly 2.1 
million kilometers/hour.

was the first mission flown under NASA™s Discov
-ery program, a series of low-cost (less than c. $150 million in mid-nineties dollar amounts) planetary 
science projects that were selected competitively 
and led by a Principal Investigator rather than a 
NASA manager. NEAR™s primary goal was to ren
-dezvous with the minor planet 433 Eros (an S-class asteroid), approximately 355 million kilometers 
from Earth, and gather data on its physical prop-erties, mineral components, morphology, internal 
mass distribution, and magnetic field. The space-craft was the first to rely on solar cells for power during operations beyond Mars orbit. On the way to its primary mission, NEAR performed a 25-minute flyby of the asteroid 253 Mathilde on 27˜June 1997. 
Closest approach to 1,200 kilometers was at 12:56 UT. During the encounter, the spacecraft photo
-graphed 60% of the minor planet from a range of 1,200 kilometers. The collected information indi-cated that the 4.5 billion-year-old asteroid is cov
-ered with craters and less dense than previously believed. After a mid-course correction on 3 July 
1997, NEAR flew by Earth on 23 January 1998 at 07:23 UT for a gravity assist on its way to Eros. Closest approach was 540 kilometers. After the 
Earth flyby encounter, NEAR™s previously planned 
mission profile had to be revised in the light of an aborted engine burn on 20 December 1998 that 
prevented a critical trajectory correction to meet up with Eros a month later. Instead, NEAR was 
put on a backup trajectory that afforded a differ-ent flyby than that originally planned. As part of 
this new plan, the spacecraft first flew past Eros on 23˜December 1998 at 18:41:23 UT at a range 
of 3,827 kilometers (distance measured from the center of mass) during which it observed about 60% of the asteroid, and discovered that the minor 
planet was smaller than expected. NEAR also found that the asteroid has two medium-sized cra-ters, a long surface ridge, and a density similar to Earth™s crust. After several more trajectory adjust
-ments, NEAR finally moved into orbit around Eros at 15:33 UT on 14 February 2000, roughly a year 
later than intended, becoming the first human-made object to orbit a minor planet. Orbital param-eters were 321 × 366 kilometers. Through 2000, NEAR™s orbit was shifted in stages to permit spe
-cific research programs. There were a few prob
-lems in the lead up to the landing on the asteroid. For example, on 13 May 2000, controllers had to 
turn off the Near Infrared Spectrometer due to an excessive power surge. By 30 April the spacecraft 
was in its operational orbit at an altitude of about 50 kilometers from Eros™ center. Later, on 13 July, 
192
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
NEAR entered an even lower orbit at 35 kilometers that brought the vehicle as close as 19 kilometers 
from the surface. After about 10 days, it moved 
back into a higher orbit. On 26 October, NEAR 
performed another close flyby of the surface, this 
time to just 5.3 kilometers. By the end of the year, 
the spacecraft had entered a circular 35-kilometer low orbit around the asteroid, and began to make a series of very close passesŠon the order of 5 to 6 kilometersŠto its surface. Following a slow 
controlled descent, during which it took 69 high-
 resolution photos of Eros, NEAR touched down 
on Eros at a gentle 6.4 kilometers/hour, just south 
of a saddle-shaped feature named Himeros, on 12 February 2001 at 19:44 UT. This was the first time 
a U.S. spacecraft was the first to land on a celestial body, having been beaten by the Soviets in land
-ing on the Moon, Mars, and Venus. Remarkably, 
the orbiter survived contact and returned valuable 
data, especially from its gamma-ray spectrometer, 
for about two weeks. Last contact with NEAR was on 28 February 2001, the spacecraft having suc
-cumbed to the extreme cold (Œ173°C). NASA™s 
attempt to contact the probe nearly two years later on 10 December 2002 was unsuccessful. NEAR data showed that Eros had no magnetic field. It mapped more than 70% of the surface using the near infrared spectrometer and provided important data about the asteroid™s interior. The spacecraft 
returned about 10 times more data than originally planned, including 160,000 images. Earlier, on 
14˜March 2000, a month after entering asteroid 
orbit, NASA renamed the NEAR spacecraft NEAR Shoemaker in honor of Eugene M. Shoemaker (1928Œ1997), the renowned geologist.183

Mars every 26 months from 1996 to 2005, and for-mulated (in 1994) to economize costs and maxi-mize returns by involving a single industrial partner with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to design, build, and deliver a flight-worthy vehicle for Mars every two years. (A new Mars Exploration Program was inaugurated in 2000.) The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft carried five instruments similar to those carried by the lost Mars Observer probe that fell silent in 1993. Among its instruments was a 
French-supplied radio relay experiment to serve 
as a downlink for future Mars landers, including for the then-planned Russian Mars 96 mission. After mid-course corrections on 21 November 
1996 and 20 March 1997, Mars Global Surveyor entered a highly elliptical orbit around Mars on 12 September 1997 after engine ignition at 01:17 UT. Initial orbital parameters were 262 × 54,026 
kilometers. Commencement of its planned two-year mission was delayed because one of its two solar panels (-Y) had not fully deployed soon after launch. The solar panels were designed to act as 
atmospheric brakes to alter its orbit. As a result, 
mission planners reconfigured the aerobraking pro
-cess required to place the vehicle in its intended 193
1996
 orbit: the modified aerobraking maneuver began on 17 September 1997 and lasted until 11 October. A 
second aerobraking phase lasted from November 1997 to March 1998 and a third one began in November 1998 whose goal was to reduce the high point of its orbit down to 450 kilometers. The revised maneuvers were finally completed on 4 February 1999 with a major burn from its main 
engine. A subsequent firing on 19 February finally 
put Mars Global Surveyor into a near-circular polar 
orbit at 235 kilometersŠand on 9 March 1999, its mapping mission formally began. The orbit was Sun-synchronous, ensuring that all its images were taken by the spacecraft of the same surface features at different times under identical light-ing conditions. Despite the early problems, Mars Global Surveyor, already during its movement to its 
new orbit, began to send back impressive data and high-resolution images of the surface of Mars. The spacecraft tracked the evolution of a dust storm, gathered information on the Martian terrain, found compelling evidence indicating the presence of liquid water at or near the surface (first announced by NASA on 22 June 2000). During its mission, 
Mars Global Surveyor also produced the first three-dimensional profiles of Mars™ north pole using 
laser altimeter readings. The spacecraft™s primary 
mission was concluded on 1 February 2001, by 
which time it had returned 83,000 images of Mars, more than all previous missions to Mars combined. In addition, the laser altimeter essentially mapped almost all of the planet, by firing approximately 500 billion pulses at the surface, providing topo-graphical data that was more detailed than many places on Earth. On 1 February 2001, Mars Global 
Surveyor™s mission was extended for a year, and 
then again on 1 February 2002, this time continu
-ing 11 months. In the early 2000s, the spacecraft supported other missions to Mars, including that of Mars Odyssey (in 2001) and the Mars Exploration Rovers (in 2004) by providing either atmospheric data or relaying telemetry back to Earth. Between 2004 and 2006, it conducted experiments simul-taneously with the European Mars Express. On 1 October 2006, mission planners, based on the recommendations of a Senior Review Board, once again extended its mission by another two years but only a month later, on 2 November, the space
-craft lost contact with Earth when attempting to orient a solar panel. Although weak signals were 
received three days later, on 21 November 2006, 
NASA announced that the mission of Mars Global Surveyor was over. The final problem was probably 
related to a flaw in the system™s software.

Results: Mars 8, the only Soviet/Russian lunar or planetary probe in the 1990s, was an ambitious mission to investigate the evolution of the Martian atmosphere, its surface, and its interior. Originally 
planned as two spacecraft, Mars 94 and Mars 96, the missions were delayed and became Mars 96 and Mars 98. Subsequently Mars 98 was cancelled leaving Mars 96 as the first Russian deep space 
mission beyond Earth orbit since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The entire spacecraft comprised an orbiter, two small autonomous stations, and two 
independent penetrators. The three-axis stabilized orbiter carried two platforms for pointing several optical instruments for studying the Martian sur-face and atmosphere. After an initial period in 
low orbit lasting three to four weeks acting as a relay to the landers, the orbiter was designed to spend approximately two Earth years in a 250 × 18,000-kilometer orbit at 101° inclination mapping Mars. The orbiter would have released the two 88-kilogram small autonomous stations (Malaya avtonomnaya stantsiya, MAS), four to five days before entering orbit. The small stations would have landed on the Martian surface, cushioned by an inflatable shell that was to split open after 
landing. The stations were to have transmitted data daily (initially) and then every three days for about 20 minutes each session. The stations would have also studied soil characteristics and taken photos on the surface. The two 123-kilogram penetrators, each 2.1 meters long, would have impacted the Martian surface at a velocity of 76 meters/second to reach about 6 to 8 meters in depth. The plan was for the orbiter to release them between 7 and 28 days after entering orbit. During their one-year life
-times, the penetrators would have served as nodes of a seismic network. In the event, the Proton-K rocket successfully delivered the payload to Earth orbit (after the first firing of the Blok D-2 upper stage). Initial orbit parameters were 150.8 × 165.7 
kilometers at 51.53° inclination. At that point, the 
Blok D-2 was to fire once again to place Mars 8 into an elliptical orbit, after which the Fregat pro
-pulsion module (with its S5.92 engine) would have sent the spacecraft on a Martian encounter trajec
-tory. The Blok D-2 was to have fired at 10:57:46 
UT on 16 November for 528 seconds but either didn™t fire or shut down very soon after ignition, 
thus putting its precious payload into an incorrect and similar orbit of 143.7 × 169.6 kilometers. Mars 8 and its Fregat module then automatically sepa
-rated from the Blok D-2. The latter seems to have 195
1996
 fired (as planned earlier), placing Mars 8 in an 80 × 1,500-kilometer orbit that deposited the planetary 
probe in Earth™s atmosphere, with reentry between 
12:30 and 01:30 UT on November 17, probably over southern Chile. Various parts of the vehicle, 

including 200 grams of plutonium-238, must have 
survived the reentry although there have been no reports of detection. Mars 8 was scheduled to 
arrive in Mars orbit on 23 September 1997.185

Results: Mars Pathfinder was an ambitious mission 
to send a lander and a separate remote-controlled 
rover to the surface of Mars, the second of NASA™s 
Discovery missions. Launched one month after Mars Global Surveyor, Pathfinder was sent on a 

slightly shorter seven-month trajectory designed for arrival earlier. The main spacecraft included 

a 10.5-kilogram six-wheeled rover known as 
Sojourner capable of traveling 500 meters from the main ship at top speeds of 1 centimeter/second. The mission™s primary goal was not only to demon
-strate innovative, low-cost technologies, but also to 
return geological, soil, magnetic property and atmo-spheric data. After a 7-month traverse and four 

trajectory corrections (on 10 January, 3 February, 

6 May, and 25 June 1997), Pathfinder arrived at 

Mars on 4 July 1997. The spacecraft entered the atmosphere using an atmospheric entry aeroshell that slowed the spacecraft sufficiently for a super-sonic parachute to deploy and slow the package to 
68 meters/second. After separation of the aeroshell 
heatshield, the lander detached, and at about 355 meters above the surface, airbags inflated in less 
than a second. Three solid propellant retro-rockets 
reduced velocity further (firing about 100 meters above the surface) but were then discarded at 21.5 meters altitudeŠthey flew up and away along 

with the parachute. The lander-within-the-airbag 

impacted on the surface at a velocity of 14 meters/
second generating about 18 g™s of acceleration. The 
package bounced at least 15 times before coming to rest, following which the airbags deflated reveal-ing the lander. Landing time for Pathfinder was

16:56:55 UT on 4 July 1997 at 19° 7˜ 48˛ N / 33° 13˜ 12˛ W in Ares Vallis, about 19 kilometers south
-west of the original target. The next day, Pathfinder 
deployed the Sojourner rover on the Martian sur-face via landing ramps. Sojourner was the first wheeled vehicle to be used on any planet. During its 83-day mission, the rover covered hundreds of square meters, returned 550 photographs and per
-formed chemical analyses at 16 different locations near the lander. The latter meanwhile transmitted 
more than 16,500 images and 8.5 million measure-ments of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and windspeed. Data from the rover suggested that rocks at the landing site resembled terrestrial vol
-canic types with high silicon content, specifically a rock type known as andesite. Although the planned 
lifetime of Pathfinder and Sojourner were expected 
to be one month and one week respectively, these 
times were exceeded by 3 and 12 times respectively. 
Final contact with Pathfinder was at 10:23˜UT 
on 27 September 1997. Although mission plan
-ners tried to reestablish contact for the next five 
months, the highly successful mission was officially declared over on 10 March 1998. After landing, 
Mars Pathfinder was renamed the Sagan Memorial 
Station after the late astronomer and planetologist Carl Sagan. In 2003, Sojourner was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame. On 21 December 2006, 
NASA™s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter™s HIRISE 
camera photographed the flood plain of the Ares 
and Tiu outflow channels; images clearly showed 
the Pathfinder and associated˜hardware.

(ACE) spacecraft was designed to study space-borne energetic particles from the SunŒEarth L1 
libration point, about 1.4 million kilometers from Earth. Specifically, the spacecraft was launched 
to investigate the matter ejected from the Sun to establish the commonality and interaction between the Sun, Earth, and the Milky Way galaxy. In addi
-tion, ACE also provides real-time space weather 
data and advanced warning of geomagnetic storms. ACE™s nine instruments have a collecting power 
that is 10 to 10,000 times greater than anything 
previously flown. After launch, the spacecraft™s 
Delta 2 launch vehicle™s second stage reignited 
(after 4 hours) to insert the satellite into a 177 × 1.37 million-kilometer orbit. After reaching apogee 
a month after launch, ACE inserted itself into its 
Lissajous orbit around the L1 point. The spacecraft was declared operational on 21 January 1998 with 
a projected two- to five-year lifetime. As of early 
2015, it continues to provide near-real-time 24/7 
coverage of solar wind parameters and measure solar energetic particle intensities. With the excep
-tion of the SEPICA instrument (data from which 
was no longer received after 4 February 2005), all 
instruments on ACE remain operational as of mid-
2017, and the propellant on board could theoreti-cally allow a mission until about 2024.187

Results: The Cassini-Huygens project was the result of plans at NASA dating from the early 1980s and formally approved in 1989 as a joint NASA-ESA mission. Having survived several attempts by Congress to cancel the mission, the mission that 

emerged was a cooperative project with ESA (as 

well as the Italian Space Agency, ASI) involving a 
NASA-supplied spacecraft, Cassini, that orbits 
Saturn, and an ESA-supplied lander, Huygens, 

which descended into the atmosphere of Titan, 

Saturn™s largest moon, in 2005. ASI provided the 
high-gain and low-gain antenna assembly and a major portion of the radio system. The primary sci
-entific goals of the mission included a diverse set of 
investigations of Saturn, its moons, and its near environment. The 3,132-kilogram orbiter with an 
original design life of 11 years was powered by 
three radioisotope thermoelectric generators 
(RTGs), of the same design as the RTGs carried aboard Ulysses, Galileo, and New Horizons. The 
335-kilogram Huygens, named after the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629Œ1695), was 
designed to investigate Titan™s atmosphere™s chem
-
ical properties and measure wind, temperature, and pressure profiles from 170 kilometers down to the Moon™s surface. The probe was not designed to 

survive past landing although scientists did not rule 
out the possibility entirely. Cassini™s trip to Saturn 
included four gravity assists. Seven months after launch, the spacecraft passed Venus on April 26, 

1988 at a range of 284 kilometers, gaining 26,280 
kilometers/hour. Cassini performed a second flyby 
of Venus on June 24, 1999 at a range of 623 kilo
-meters and one of Earth at 03:28 UT on 18 August 

1999 at a range of 1,171 kilometers, before heading 
to Jupiter. During this portion of the traverse, 
Cassini passed by the asteroid 2685 Masursky on 199

23˜January 2000, flying as close as 1.5 million kilo
-meters at 09:58 UT. During the encounter, Cassini 
used its remote sensing instruments to investigate the asteroid™s size and dimensions and albedo. 
Nearly a year later, on 30 December 2000, the 

spacecraft passed by Jupiter at a distance of about 
9.7 million kilometers. Among the data it returned 
was a detailed global color image of Jupiter, proba
-bly the most complete of the whole planet ever pro-duced. In 2001Œ2002, controllers noticed a ﬁhazeﬂ in images returned by the narrow-angle camera but these were eliminated following phases of heating the spacecraft. Its investigations en route to Saturn 
included an experiment in October 2003 in which 
scientists observed a frequency shift in radio waves to and from the probe as those signals traveled close to the Sun. These results confirmed theoreti-cal predictions based on Einstein™s general theory 
of relativity. In May 2004, Cassini-Huygens entered 
the Saturn system, i.e., the gravitational pull of Saturn became higher than the pull from the Sun. 
After over five years of inactivity, Cassini™s main 

engine was fired on 27 May as a test prior to orbital 
insertion. After a flyby of the Moon Phoebe on 
June 11 (at a distance of just 2,068 kilometers), 

Cassini performed one more correction five days 

later. Finally, on 1 July 2004, the spacecraft engine 
fired for 96 minutes, thus inserting Cassini-Huygens into a 0.02 × 9 million-kilometer orbit 
around Saturn. It was the first human-made object 
to enter orbit around Saturn. In its initial months, 
Cassini provided detailed data on Titan during

 three flybys (on 2 July, 27 October, and 
13˜December) and discovered two small new 
moons (Methone and Pallene). On Christmas Day 
2004 at 02:00 UT, the Huygens lander, which had 
remained dormant for more than six years, sepa-rated from Cassini and began its 22-day coast to 
Titan. It entered Titan™s atmosphere at 09:05:56 
UT on 14 January 2005 and within 4 minutes had 
deployed its 8.5-meter diameter main parachute. A 
minute later, Huygens began transmitting a wealth 
of information back to Cassini for over 2 hours 
before impacting on the surface of Titan at 11:38:11 
UT at a velocity of 4.54 meters/second. Landing 
coordinates were 192.32° W / 10.25° S, about 7 
kilometers from its target point. A problem in the 
communications program limited the number of 
images that Huygens transmitted to Cassini, from 
about 700 to 376. Yet, to the excitement of plane
-tary scientists back on Earth, it continued its trans-missions for another 3 hours and 10 minutes during 
which it transmitted a view of its surroundings (224 
images of the same view). Huygens appears to have 
landed in surface resembling ﬁsandﬂ made of ice 
grains; surface pictures showed a flat plain littered 
with pebbles as well as evidence of liquid acting on 
the terrain in the recent past. Subsequent data con
-firmed the existence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in 
the polar regions of Titan. In April 2016, ESA 
announced that one of Titan™s three large seas close 
to the north pole, known as Ligela Mare, is filled 
with pure liquid methane, with a seabed covered by 
a ﬁsludgeﬂ of organic-rich material. The Cassini 
orbiter meanwhile continued its main orbital mis
-sion investigating the Saturn system, its voyage 
punctuated by repeated ﬁtargetedﬂ flybysŠflybys 
actively implemented by trajectory correctionsŠof 
various moons, particularly Titan, Enceladus, 
Tethys, Hyperion, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus. 
Cassini ended its primary mission on 27˜May 2008 
with its 43rd flyby of Titan. During this period, the 
spacecraft discovered two new moons (Daphnis 
and Anthe), uncovered much valuable data about 
Titan, including the first radar images of the moon™s 
surface taken during its 27˜October 2004 flyby and 
clear evidence of existing large lakes of liquid 
hydrocarbon in the northern latitudes of Titan, and 
performed a number of radio occultation experi-ments to study the size-distribution of particles in 
Saturn™s rings and atmosphere. Perhaps the most 
exciting flyby was one on 12˜March 2008 when 
Cassini flew within 50 kilometers of the surface of 
Enceladus, passing through the plumes from its 
southern geysers. The spacecraft detected water 
and carbon dioxide and also mapped surface fea-tures. In April 2008, NASA approved a two-year 
extension of its mission (i.e., 60 more Saturn 
orbits), which officially began on 1˜July 2008 and 
was called the Cassini Equinox Mission, named as 
such because the mission coincided with Saturn™s 
equinox. Further moons of Saturn were identified 
(Aegaeon and S/2009 S 1, the latter a ﬁpropeller 
moonletﬂ perhaps only 400 meters across) while 
additional encounters with Enceladus allowed 
Cassini to acquire very high-resolution images of 
its surface and directly sample its cryo-volcanic 
plumes that appear to contain complex organic 
chemicals. During the two-year Equinox Mission, 
which ended in September 2010, Cassini per-formed 26 targeted flybys of Titan, 7 of Enceladus, 
and 1 each of Dione, Rhea, and Helene. On 
3˜February 2010, NASA announced that Cassini™s 
mission would continue beyond the original two-year extension into the new Cassini Solstice 
Mission that would last until September 2017, a 
few months past Saturn™s summer solstice. The 
new mission was named after the Saturnian 
summer solstice occurring in May 2017, which 
marked the beginning of summer in the northern 
hemisphere and winter in the southern hemi-sphere. (The spacecraft had arrived at Saturn just 
after the planet™s northern winter solstice. The 
extension thus allowed scientists to study a com
-plete seasonal period of the planet.) The Cassini 
Solstice Mission was guided principally by its abil-ity to continue close studies of Titan (particularly 
seasonal climate change such as storms, flooding, 
202BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
and changes in lakes) and Enceladus (particularly, 
its ﬁastrobiological potentialﬂ) but also some of the other icy moons (such as Dione and Rhea), the planet itself (and its magnetosphere), and its rings. The extension allowed 155 orbits around Saturn 155 times, plus 54 flybys of Titan, 11 of Enceladus, 
2 of Rhea, and 3 of Dione. At the beginning of the 
Solstice Mission, on 2 November 2010, Cassini 
ran into a problem when a malfunction in the 
spacecraft™s computer shut down all nonessential 
systems. Slowly, over a period of about three weeks, 
controllers were able to restore all of Cassini™s 
instruments to working order. Only one targeted 
flyby of Titan was affected during the interim. On 
6 March 2014, the spacecraft conducted its 100th flyby of Titan (at a range of 1,500 kilometers), con
-ducting gravity measurements in order to explore the existence of a global subsurface ocean. By July 2014, Cassini had identified at least 101 distinct geysers erupting on the south polar region of Enceledaus. Researchers concluded that it is pos-sible for liquid water to reach all the way to the surface from the moon™s underground sea (whose 
existence had been announced in April 2014). The 
presence of this salty underground ocean, about 30Œ40 kilometers thick, under a 10-kilometer ice shell, raises the possibility that microbial life might exist there. Significant events in 2015Œ2016 included a close flyby (at 47,000 kilometers) of Rhea in February 2015, allowing very high-resolu
-tion images of the natural satellite, a flyby (at 34,000 kilometers) of the irregularly-shaped Hyperion in May 2015 showing a deeply impact-scarred surface, and two last flybys of Dione in 
June and August 2015, at just 516 and 474 kilome
-ters range, respectively. Perhaps the most spectac
-ular mission event of the year was Cassini™s 
ﬁdeep-diveﬂ to just 49 kilometers above the south polar region of the geologically active Enceladus in October 2015. During the encounter, the space
-craft™s gas analyzer and dust detector instruments 
sampled the moon™s plume of gas and dust-sized icy 
particles. A final flyby of Enceladus was carried out 
in December at a range of 4,999 kilometers, con
-cluding a chapter in the Cassini mission™s encoun
-ters with Saturn™s moons. In December 2015, 
Cassini initiated a number of delicate orbital maneuvers designed to tilt the spacecraft™s orbit 
out of Saturn™s ringplane. Each maneuver was fol
-lowed by a gravity-assist from Titan (ﬁTitan does all 
the heavy lifting,ﬂ noted Earl Maize, Cassini proj-ect manager at JPL), thus sending the vehicle to an 
increasingly higher inclination (relative to Saturn™s 
equator). These maneuvers set up Titan for its final 
dramatic year in 2016Œ2017, involving two distinct phases of the mission. On 30˜November 2016, 
Cassini set off on a path that carried it high above and under Saturn™s poles, diving every seven days 
through the hitherto unexplored region at the outer edge of the main rings. This phase of the mission, 
called ﬁCassini™s Ring-Grazing Orbitsﬂ involved 20 
ﬁdivesﬂ through this region, that ended on 22 April 
2017. During some of these passes, the spacecraft directly sampled ring particles and molecules of faint gases close to the rings. In March and April 
2017, ring crossings had the spacecraft fly through the dusty outer regions of the F ring. After the last 
ring-grazing orbit concluded on 22 April 2017, a 
flyby of Titan reshaped Cassini™s trajectory to send 
it on a new phase of the mission, the ﬁGrand Finale,ﬂ involving 22 plunges, the first on 26 April 
through the 2,400-kilometer gap between Saturn and its innermost ring. The mission concluded on 15˜September 2017 on its 293rd orbit of Saturn 
when Cassini plunged into the Saturnian atmo-sphere ending one of the most ambitious and spec-tacular missions in the history of planetary exploration. By most estimates, the spacecraft 
burned up in the atmosphere and was destroyed about 45 seconds after the last transmission. During the final moments of the descent, data from eight of Cassini™s science instruments beamed 
important data back to Earth, giving insight into the planet™s formation and evolution. Cassini was 
named after Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini (1625Œ1712).2031997

Mission Design and Management: Asiasat (operator) + 
Hughes (design and manufacture)
Launch Vehicle:
 Proton-K + Blok DM3 (8K82K no.

Launch Date and Time:
 24 December 1997 / 23:19 UT
Launch Site: GIK-5 / Site 81/23
Scientific Instruments: [none]
Results: The lunar flyby accomplished by Asiasat 3 
was not part of a science mission but rather the end result of a rescue mission of a satellite that had been stranded in an incorrect orbit. Asiasat 3 was 
a communications satellite, based on the Hughes HS-601HP bus, launched by the Russians for Asia 
Satellite Telecommunications Co. Because of the 
improper second firing of the Blok DM3 upper 
stage, the satellite ended up in a useless 203 × 36,000-kilometer orbit around the Earth and writ-ten off as a loss by Asiasat. Insurance underwriters 
subsequently signed an agreement with Hughes Global Systems who built the satellite to salvage the vehicle and bring it to its originally intended geostationary orbit by using as little propellant as possible. Using 11 carefully-planned burns begin-ning 12 April 1998, controllers raised the orbit™s 
apogee to 321,000 kilometers. Then, with the 12th firing on 7 May 1998, the spacecraft was sent on a nine-day round trip around the Moon, approach-ing as close as 6,200 kilometers to its surface on 13 May. Using this gravity assist, Asiasat 3 hurled 
back into a usable orbit. By 16 May 1998, perigee had been raised to 42,000 kilometers and inclina-tion reduced from 51° to 18°. A second circumlu
-nar mission began on 1 June that culminated in a 34,300-kilometer flyby of the Moon on 6 June, a 
distance closer than the Soviet Luna 3. After four 
more engine firings, the satellite was finally in a 24-hour geosynchronous orbit by 17 June 1998 above 153°. The satellite, now owned by Hughes, was renamed HGS 1. In 1999, HGS-1 was bought by PanAmSat and renamed PAS 22 and moved to 
60° W, and subsequently, in July 2002, it was deac
-tivated and moved to a graveyard orbit.2051998

Launch Date and Time:
 7 January 1998 / 02:28:44 UT

Scientific Instruments:1. electron reflectometer and magnetometer (MAG/ER)2. gamma-ray spectrometer (GRS)3. neutron spectrometer (NS)4. alpha particle spectrometer (APS)5. Doppler gravity experiment (using S-band antenna) (DGE)Results: Lunar Prospector was designed to collect data to compile the first complete compositional and gravity maps of the Moon during its planned 
one-year mission in lunar polar orbit. It was the third mission of NASA™s Discovery Program of low-
cost, highly-focused, and relatively frequent mis-sions that were competitively selected. After two 
mid-course corrections, Lunar Prospector entered orbit around the Moon 105 hours after launch. Initial parameters were 92 × 153 kilometers. After 
two further corrections on 13 and 15 January, 
the spacecraft entered its operational 100 × 100-
 kilometer orbit at 90° inclination with a period of 118 minutes. Perhaps of most interest to scientists 
was to continue investigations into the signs of water ice on the Moon as found by the Clementine probe. In March 1998, NASA announced that data from Lunar Prospector suggested the presence of water ice at both the lunar poles; the neutron spec-trometer instrument detected hydrogen, assumed to be in the form of water. The information indi
-cated that a large amount of water ice, possibly as much as 300 million (metric) tons was mixed into the regolith at each pole, the first direct evi-dence of water ice at the lunar poles. The space-craft also detected strong localized magnetic fields, mapped the global distribution of major rock types, 
and discovered signs of a 600-kilometer diame-ter, iron-rich core. On 10 December 1998, Lunar 
Prospector™s orbit was lowered to 40 kilometers 
to perform high-resolution studies. A subsequent 
maneuver on 28 January 1999 changed the orbit to 15 × 45 kilometers and ended the space probe™s 
primary mission but began an extended mission for an additional seven months. Lunar Prospector was deliberately impacted onto the shadowed 
Shoemaker crater on the lunar surface at 09:52:02 UT on 31˜July 1999. Observations of the result
-ing dust cloud by Earth-based telescopes showed no spectral signature characteristic of water vapor. 
The vehicle carried part of the cremated remains of geologist Eugene Shoemaker to the lunar surface.190

Launch Site: Kagoshima / Launch Complex M-5
Scientific Instruments: 1. Mars imaging camera (MIC) 2. magnetic field measurement instrument (magnetometer) (MGF) 3. electron spectrum analyzer (ESA) 4. ion spectrum analyzer (ISA) 5. ion mass imager (IMI) 6. electron and ion spectrometer (EIS) 7. thermal plasma analyzer (TPA)

Results: Nozomi, Japan™s fourth ﬁdeep spaceﬂ probe, 
was also its first planetary spacecraft and the first directed to Mars that was not from the United States or the Soviet Union/Russia. The spacecraft was slated to enter a highly elliptical orbit around Mars on 11 October 1999. Its mission was to con-duct long-term investigations of the planet™s upper 
atmosphere and its interactions with the solar wind and track the escape trajectories of oxygen molecules from Mars™ thin atmosphere. It was 
also to have taken pictures of the planet and its 
moons from its operational orbit of 300 × 47,500 kilometers; during perigee, Nozomi would have performed remote sensing of the atmosphere and surface while close to apogee, the spacecraft would have studied ions and neutral gas escaping from the planet. Although designed and built by Japan, 
the spacecraft carried a set of 14 instruments 
from Japan, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the 
United States. After entering an elliptical parking 
orbit around Earth at 340 × 400,000 kilometers, Nozomi was sent on an interplanetary trajectory that involved two gravity-assist flybys of the Moon on 24 September and 18 December 1998 (at 2,809 
kilometers), and one of Earth on 20 December 1998 (at 1,003 kilometers). The gravitational assist from Earth as well as a 7-minute engine burn put Nozomi on an escape trajectory towards Mars. Unfortunately, a problem valve resulted in loss 
of propellant, leaving the spacecraft with insuffi-cient acceleration to reach its nominal trajectory. 
Subsequently, because two more mid-course cor
-rections on 21 December used more propellant 
than intended, Nozomi™s originally planned mis
-sion had to be completely reconfigured. The new 
plan involved four further years in heliocentric 
orbit, during which time it would conduct two more Earth flybys (in December 2002 and June 
2003) leading to a Mars encounter in December 2003, four years after its original schedule. While heading towards Earth, on 21 April 2002, power
-ful solar flares damaged Nozomi™s communications 
and power systems, causing the hydrazine to freeze in the vehicle™s attitude control system. Contact 
was lost with the spacecraft on 15 May but two months later, controllers found the spacecraft™s 
beacon. Mission scientists were able to thaw the frozen fuel as it approached Earth and the flybys were accomplished as intended: on 21 December 2002 at a range of 29,510 kilometers and once again on 19 June 2003 at a range of 11,023 kilo-meters. Soon after, the spacecraft™s luck finally ran 
out: on 9 December 2003, in anticipation of the 
Mars orbit insertion (planned for five days later), 
the main thruster failed, essentially ending its mis-sion. Instead, ground controllers commanded lower 
thrust attitude control thrusters to fire to ensure that 
Nozomi would not impact onto the Martian surface, 
which would have been a problem since the space-craft had not been sterilized. The spacecraft passed 
by Mars at a range of 1,000 kilometers and remains 
in heliocentric orbit. Despite not accomplishing its 
primary mission, Nozomi provided important data 
from its suite of scientific instruments.2071998

Launch Complex 17A

5. Beacon monitor operations experiment6. small deep-space transponder (SDST)7. miniature integrated camera spectrometer (MICAS)
8. plasma experiment for planetary exploration instrument (REPE)9. Ka-band solid-state power amplifierResults: Deep Space 1 (DS1) was designed to test new innovative technologies appropriate for future deep space and interplanetary missions. It was the first in a new series of technology demonstration missions under NASA™s New Millennium program. 
The spacecraft™s main goals were to test 12 ﬁhigh-
riskﬂ technologies as ion propulsion, autonomous optical navigation, a solar power concentration 
array, and a combination miniature camera/imag
-ing spectrometer. As a bonus, the spacecraft also 
flew by the asteroid 9969 Braille. After a success
-ful launch into parking orbit around Earth, a third stage burn at 13:01 UT on 24 October 1998 put 
DS1 on a heliocentric trajectory. On 10 November 
controllers commanded the ion thruster to fire for 
the first time but it operated for only 4.5 minutes before stopping. Two weeks later, on 24˜November 
1998, controllers once again fired Deep Space 1™s 
ion propulsion system (fueled by xenon gas) when the spacecraft was 4.8 million kilometers from Earth. This time, the engine ran continuously for 14 days and demonstrated a specific impulse of 3,100 seconds, as much as 10 times higher than possible with conventional chemical propellants. The mission tested its payload extensively to ensure that future users of such technologies would not take on unnecessary risks. DS1 passed by the near-
Earth asteroid 9660 Braille at 04:46 UT on 29 July 1999 at a range of only 26 kilometers at a veloc-ity of 15.5 kilometers/second. Although it was the 
closest asteroid flyby to date, it was only partially successful due to a problem that compromised 
data delivered to the onboard navigational system. These difficulties prevented a closer encounter, 
originally planned at 240 meters range. The few images returned from very long range were out of focus although much other data was useful. DS1 
found Braille to be 2.2 kilometers at its longest and 1 kilometer at its shortest. Once the successful primary mission was over by 18 September 1999, NASA formulated an extended mission. Originally, 
the plan had been to have DS1 fly by the dor
-mant Comet 107P/Wilson-Harrington in January 
2001 and the Comet 19P/Borrelly in September 2001, but the spacecraft™s star tracker failed on 
11˜November 1999. The continuation of the mis
-sion without the use of the star trackerŠwhich ini-tially was thought to be fatal to the mission since the spacecraft could not point its ion engine or sensors in the proper directionsŠrequired considerable ingenuity and effort on the part of controllers. Over two months, the operations team struggled to have the spacecraft point its antenna to Earth allowing it to download data on the tracker™s failure (as well as 
other data collected by DS1). Over the subsequent five months, the team devised an innovative plan to revive the vehicle, by ﬁbuildingﬂ a new attitude control system operating without the failed star tracker. Although it was no longer possible to visit 
the bonus targets (given its limited capability), DS1 208BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
was still healthy enough to be targeted to Borrelly 
with the hope of arriving in September 2001. By 
the end of 1999, DS1™s ion engine had expended 
22 kilograms of xenon to impart a total delta V of 
1,300 meters/second. On its way to Borrelly, it set 
the record for the longest operating time for a pro-pulsion system in space. By 17 August 2000, the 
engine had been operating for 162 days as part of 
an eight-month run. On 22 September 2001, DS1 
entered the coma of Comet Borrelly, making its clos
-est approach of 2,171 kilometers to the nucleus at 
22:29:33 UT. Traveling at 16.58 kilometers/second 
relative to the nucleus at the time, it returned some 
of the best images of a comet ever as well as other 
significant data. The spacecraft™s ion engine was 
finally turned off on 18 December 2001, having 
operated for 16,265 hours and provided a total 
delta-V of 4.3 kilometers/second, the largest delta-V 
achieved by a spacecraft with its own propulsion 
system. By this point, the spacecraft had operated 
far beyond its planned lifetime and was running low 
on attitude control hydrazine. A radio receiver was 
left on in case future contact with the spacecraft 
was desired, although an attempt in March 2002 to 
contact the spacecraft was unsuccessful.192

Scientific Instruments:1. pressure modulated infrared radiometer (PMIRR)2. Mars color imaging system (two cameras) (MARCI)Results: Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO) was the 
second probe in NASA™s Mars Surveyor program, 
which also included the Mars Global Surveyor 
(launched in November 1996) and Mars Polar 
Lander (launched in January 1999). Mars Climate 
Orbiter was designed to arrive at roughly the same 
time as Mars Polar Lander and conduct simultane
-ous investigations of Mars™ atmosphere, climate, and 
surface. Arrival in orbit was dated for 23˜September 
1999; MCO would then attain its operational 
near-circular Sun-synchronous orbit at 421 kilome
-ters by 1 December 1999. The satellite was also 
designed to serve as a communications relay for 
Mars Polar Lander. After the lander™s mission lasting 
three months, MCO would have performed a two-year independent mission to monitor atmospheric 
dust and water vapor and take daily pictures of the 
planet™s surface to construct an evolutionary map 
of climatic changes. Scientists hoped that such 
information would aid in reconstructing Mars™ cli
-matic history and provide evidence on buried water 
reserves. After the end of its main mapping mission 
on 15 January 2001, Mars Climate Orbiter would 
have acted as a communications relay for future 
NASA missions to Mars. After launch, the space
-craft was put into a Hohmann transfer orbit to 
intersect with Mars. It performed four mid-course 
corrections on 21˜December 1998, 4 March, 
25˜July, and 15˜September 1999. At 09:00:46 UT 
on 23 September 1999, the orbiter began its Mars 
orbit insertion burn as planned. The spacecraft 
was scheduled to reestablish contact after passing 
behind Mars, but, unfortunately, no further signals 
were received from the spacecraft. An investigation 
indicated that the failure resulted from a naviga-tional error due to commands from Earth being 
sent in English units (in this case, pound-seconds) 
without being converted into the metric standard 
(Newton-seconds). The error caused the orbiter to 
miss its intended 140Œ150-kilometer altitude orbit 
and instead fall into the Martian atmosphere at 
approximately 57 kilometers altitude and disinte-grate due to atmospheric stresses.2091999

8. Mars microphoneResults: The Mars Polar Lander (MPL) was one of 
NASA™s Mars Surveyor missions that called for a 
series of small, low-cost spacecraft for sustained exploration of Mars. MPL™s primary goal was to 
deploy a lander and two penetrators (known as Deep Space 2) on the surface of Mars to extend our knowledge on the planet™s past and present 
water resources. The objective was to explore the never-before studied carbon dioxide ice cap, about 
1,000 kilometers from the south pole. The mis-sion also called for recording local meteorological conditions, analyzing samples of polar deposits, and taking multi-spectral images of local areas. MPL was to have performed its mission simul-taneously with that of the Mars Climate Orbiter that would have acted as a communications relay 
during its surface operations. MPL itself com-prised a bus section (for power, propulsion, and 
communications during the outbound voyage) and 
a 290-kilogram lander that stood 1.06 meters tall on the ground. The lander was equipped with a 2-meter long remote arm to dig into the terrain and investigate the properties of Martian soil (using the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer). Having 
arrived at Mars on 3 December 1999, the space-craft would enter the atmosphere, and about 10 minutes prior to landing, would jettison its cruise stage and solar panels and then release the two 3.572 kilogram (each) Deep Space 2 microprobes. Unlike Mars Pathfinder, MPL was scheduled 
to make a completely controlled landing using 
retro-rockets all the way to the surface. Landing was scheduled for 21:03 UT on 3 December 1999 with two-way communications planned to begin 20 minutes later. The two Deep Space 2 microprobes 
(renamed Amundsen and Scott on 15 November 
1999), meanwhile, would impact the ground at a speed of 200 meters/second about 50Œ85 seconds 
prior to the lander and about 100 kilometers away. 
Each penetrator was designed to obtain a small 
sample of subsurface soil using an electric drill for analysis. The microprobes™ mission was expected 
to last about 36 hours while the lander mission would continue until 1 March 2000. Mars Polar 
Lander successfully left Earth on a Mars transfer trajectory on 3 January 1999. During its traverse to Mars, the spacecraft was stowed inside an aero-shell capsule. The complete vehicle approached Mars in early December in apparently good health. Last contact with the vehicle was at 20:02 UT on 210
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
3˜December 1999 as the spacecraft slewed to entry 
attitude. Then, traveling at 6.9 kilometers/second, the capsule entered the Martian atmosphere about 8 minutes later. Controllers expected to rees
-tablish contact 24 minutes after landing (sched-uled for 20:14 UT) but no signal was received. 
With no communications for over two weeks, on 
16˜December 1999, NASA used the Mars Global 
Surveyor orbiting Mars to look for signs of the 
lander on the Martian surface, but the search proved fruitless. On 17 January 2000, NASA finally terminated all attempts to establish contact with the lost lander. An independent investigation into 
the failure, whose results were released publicly on 28 March 2000, indicated that the most probable cause of the failure was the generation of spurious signals when the lander™s legs deployed during the 
descent. These signals falsely indicated that the 
spacecraft had touched down on Mars when in fact it was still descending. The main engines prema
-turely shut down, and the lander fell to the Martian landscape. The demise of MPL undoubtedly set 
NASA™s Mars exploration program back and also 
spelled the effective end of NASA™s ﬁFaster, Better, 
Cheaperﬂ initiative for low-cost highly innovative missions. The Phoenix lander, which arrived on 
Mars in 2008, subsequently accomplished most of the original Mars Polar Lander™s objectives. MPL 
carried a CD-ROM with the names of one million children from around the world as part of the ﬁSend Your Name to Marsﬂ program formulated to foster 
interest in space exploration among young people.194

Launch Complex 17A
Scientific Instruments:1. dust flux monitor instrument (DFMI)2. cometary and interstellar dust analyzer (CIDA)
3. navigation camera (NC)4. stardust sample collection (SSC)5. dynamic science experiment (DSE)Results: Stardust was the fourth of NASA™s Discovery 
program of low-cost exploration missions (after 
NEAR, Mars Pathfinder, and Lunar Prospector), 
and the first American mission dedicated solely to 
studying a comet. It was also the second robotic 
mission (after Genesis) designed to bring extrater-restrial material from beyond lunar orbit back to 
Earth. Its primary goal was to fly by the Comet Wild 
2 (pronounced ﬁvilt 2ﬂ), collect samples of dust from the coma of the comet as well as additional interstel-lar particles, and then return the samples to Earth. Stardust comprised a 254-kilogram spacecraft that included a 45.7-kilogram return capsule shaped like a blunt-nosed cone. It had five major compo
-nents: a heat shield, back shell, sample canister, 
parachute system, and avionics. The samples were to be collected using a low-density microporous silica-based substance known as aerogel, attached to panels on the spacecraft to ﬁsoft-catchﬂ and pre-serve the cometary materials. The spacecraft was launched into heliocentric orbit that would bring it around the Sun and past Earth for a gravity-assist 
maneuver to direct it to Wild 2 after a flyby of the 
minor planet Annefrank in November 2002. After 
mid-course corrections on 28 December 1999, 18˜January, 20˜January, and 22˜January 2000, its first 
interstellar dust collection operation was carried out between 22˜February and 1 May 2000. After 
approximately a year in heliocentric orbit, Stardust flew by Earth (at a range of 6,008 kilometers) on 15 January 2001 for a gravity assist to send it on a 
second sample collection exercise between July and December 2002. On 2 November 2002 at 04:50 UT, Stardust flew by asteroid 5535 Annefrank at a 
211
1999
 range of 3,078 kilometers. During the encounter, 
the spacecraft™s dust collectors collected samples 
while its camera returned 72 images. Over a year later, on 31 December 2003, the spacecraft entered 
the coma of Comet Wild 2 (or 81P/Wild) with the 
closest encounter (at a range of 250 kilometers) taking place at 19:22 UT on 2 January 2004. The sample collector, which had been deployed on 
24 December was retracted about 6 hours after 
closest approach, stowed, and then sealed in the ﬁsample vault.ﬂ The imaging system also took 72 images of the comet™s nucleus. Exactly as planned, 
after a 4.63 billion-kilometer trip lasting over two 
years, at 05:57 UT on 15 January 2006, Stardust™s 
Sample Return Capsule (SRC) separated from the main vehicle and, 4 hours later, entered Earth™s 
atmosphere. Slowed down by the drogue and main parachutes, the capsule landed at 10:10 UT within a 30 × 84-kilometer landing zone at the U.S. Air 
Force Test and Training Range in Utah. Because of 
high winds, the capsule drifted north of the ground track, but fortunately a locator beacon allowed res-cuers to find the capsule 44 minutes after landing. The capsule had returned more than 10,000 par-ticles larger than 1 micrometer from Wild 2. The 
main spacecraft, meanwhile was diverted so as not to reenter Earth™s atmosphere. At 06:13 UT on 
15˜January, it fired its engines, flew past Earth and 
then the Moon before entering hibernation mode on 29 January 2004 and remains in a 3-year-long 
heliocentric orbit. In July 2007, NASA approved an extended mission for Stardust known as New Exploration of Tempel 1 (NExT) that envisaged a 
flyby of Comet Tempel 1 (or 9P/Tempel), which 
had been the target for Deep Impact™s impact 
probe in 2005. The spacecraft, now known as Stardust/NExT, flew by Tempel 1 at 04:42:00 UT 
on 15 February 2011 at a range of 181 kilometers, 
returning 72 images of the nucleus. This was the first time a comet had been revisited. It was also during this flyby that investigators were able to conclusively identify the impact crater from Deep Impact™s Impactor probe. Stardust carried out a 
final engine burn on 24 March 2011 exhausting 
all of its propellant. It sent its last transmission at 12:33 UT the same day, ending an 11-year mission. 
The analysis of the samples returned showed the presence of a wide range of organic compounds. In August 2014, NASA announced that seven rare, 
microscopic interstellar dust particles dating from the very origins of the solar system were among the samples collected by Stardust.213

SLC-17A
Scientific Instruments:1. thermal emission imaging system (THEMIS)2. gamma ray spectrometer (GRS)3. Mars radiation environment experiment (MARIE)Results: As of mid-2017, 2001 Mars Odyssey holds 
the record for the longest surviving continually 
active spacecraft in orbit around a planet other 
than Earth, at 16 years and counting. This, the 
first launch in NASA™s revamped Mars Exploration 
Program (which was originally approved in 1993 
but restructured in October 2000 after the fail-ures associated with ﬁFaster, Better, Cheaperﬂ), 
was designed to investigate the Martian environ-ment, providing key information on its surface 
and the radiation hazards future explorers might 
face. The goal was to map the chemical and min-eralogical makeup of Mars as a step to detecting 
evidence of past or present water and volcanic 
activity on Mars. It was also designed to act as a 
relay for future landers, and did so for the Mars 
Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity), the 
Mars Science Laboratory, and the Phoenix lander. 
During the coast to Mars, in August 2001, the 
MARIE radiation instrument failed to respond but 
was successfully revived by March 2002. About 
200 days after launch, at 02:38 UT on 24 October 
2001, Mars Odyssey successfully entered orbit 
around Mars after a 20-minute, 19-second-long 
engine burn. The initial orbit was highly elliptical 
(272 × 26,818 kilometers), taking the spacecraft 
18.6 hours to complete one circuit. The spacecraft 
then implemented an unusual aerobraking maneu-ver that used the planet™s atmosphere to gradually 
bring the satellite closer to the Martian surface 
on every succeeding orbit. This process saved an 
estimated 200 kilograms of propellant. Once the 
aerobraking was over, by 30 January 2002, Mars 
Odyssey was in its nearly Sun-synchronous polar 
orbit of 400 × 400 kilometers at 93.1° inclination, 
allowing the initiation of its science and mapping 
mission on 19 February 2002. This phase lased 
917 Earth days during which entire ground tracks 
were repeated every two sols. One of the most 
exciting findings of Mars Odyssey came early on 
in the mission. In May 2002, NASA announced 
that the probe had identified large amounts of 
hydrogen in the soil, implying the presence of ice 
possibly a meter below the planet™s surface. Much 
later, in March 2008, mission scientists revealed 
that Mars Odyssey had found evidence of salt 
deposits in 200 locations in southern Mars. These 
chloride minerals were left behind as places where 
water was once abundant. Having fully completed 
its primary mission by August 2004, mission plan
-ers began a series of extended missions starting 
24˜August 2004. NASA approved seven two-year 
extensions of the Mars Odyssey mission, in 2004, 
2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. Each 
was dedicated to a specific set of objectives. For 
example, the fourth extension ending in August 
214
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
2012 was dedicated to observing the year-to-year 
variations in polar ice, clouds, and dust storms. One 
of its instruments, the MARIE radiation experi-ment, stopped working on 28˜October 2003, after 
a large solar event bombarded the spacecraft early 
in the mission, most likely because of a damaged 
computer chip. In addition, one of the spacecraft™s 
reaction wheels failed in June 2012, but a spare, 
installed on board as a redundancy, was activated 
and spun into service a month later. A few months 
later, in August 2012, NASA used Mars Odyssey™s 
THEMIS instrument to help select a landing site 
for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and later 
acted as a relay for the MSL rover Curiosity. By 
July 2010, NASA was able to announce that Mars 
Odyssey™s camera had helped construct the most 
accurate global map of Mars ever, using 21,000 
images from the THEMIS instrument. These 
pictures have been smoothed, matched, blended, 
and cartographically controlled to make a giant 
mosaic available to users online. Later that year, 
on 15 December 2010, Mars Odyssey claimed 
the record for the longest operating spacecraft at 
Mars, with 3,340 days of operation. In December 
2016, the spacecraft put itself into ﬁsafe modeﬂ 
due to a problem with orientation relative to 
Earth and the Sun but by early January 2017 
was restored to full operating status. During its 
many years in Martian orbit, Mars Odyssey glob-ally mapped the amount and distribution of the 
numerous chemical elements and minerals in the 
Martian surface and also tracked the radiation 
environment in low Mars orbit, both necessary 
before humans can effectively explore the Martian 
surface. By mid-2016, the THEMIS instrument 
had returned more than 208,000 images in visi-ble-light wavelengths and more than 188,000 in 
thermal-infrared wavelengths.196
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP)

Spacecraft: Explorer 80
Spacecraft Mass: 840 kilograms
Mission Design and Management: NASA / GSFC
Launch Vehicle:
 Delta 7425-10 (no. D286)
Launch Date and Time:
 30 June 2001 / 19:46:46 UT
Launch Site: Cape Canaveral Air Force Station / 
SLC-17B
Scientific Instruments:1. Pseudo-Correlation Radiometer (fed by two back-to-back reflectors)Results: The Microwave Anisotropy Probe was 
designed to map the relative Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature with high angu-lar resolution and sensitivity over the full sky. In 
order to achieve this, MAP used differential micro-wave radiometers that measured temperature dif-ferences between two points on the sky from its operational position at the SunŒEarth L2 Lagrange Point, about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. 
The two back-to-back telescopes were designed to focus microwave radiation from two spots on the sky approximately 140° apart and feed it to 10 sep-arate differential receivers. The MAP mission was a successor to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission, also known as Explorer 46, 
launched in 1989. The spacecraft was launched into an initial orbit of 167 × 204 kilometers at 28.8° inclination. A third stage burn directed MAP 
into a highly elliptical orbit at 182 × 292,492 kilo-meters at 28.7° degrees. After three large ellipti
-cal loops around Earth, the spacecraft flew by the Moon on 30 July and arrived at the SunŒEarth L2 on 1 October 2001. Its position at L2 minimizes the amount of contaminating solar, terrestrial, and 
215
2001
 lunar emissions while also ensuring a stable ther
-mal state. At L2, MAP was in a 6-month Lissajous 
orbit. In 2003, MAP was renamed the Wilkinson 
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in honor 
of cosmologist and mission scientist David Todd 
Wilkinson (1935Œ2002) who passed away the year 
before. Since its operational mission began, NASA 
has issued public ﬁdata releasesﬂ in 2003, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 that have added an immense amount of rich information to our understanding 
of the origins of the universe. First and foremost, WMAP™s data played a major role in precisely con
-firming the origin, content, age, and geometry of the universe. Among its many findings has been: 
the first fine-resolution (0.2 degree) full-sky map of 
the microwave sky; a more precise determination of 
the age of the universe (13.77 billion years); more 
accurate data on the curvature of space; data that 
has allowed scientists to reduce the volume of cos-mological parameters by a factor of over 68,000; 
and the discovery that dark matter and dark energy 
(in the form of the cosmological constant) make up 
about 24.0% and 71.4% of the universe, respectively. 
All of these findings and others cumulatively pro-vided more confirmation for the prevailing standard 
model of Big Bang cosmology, the Lambda-CDM 
model. After 9 years of operation, in October 2010, 
the WMAP spacecraft was moved to a derelict 
heliocentric graveyard orbit outside L2 where the 
probe will circle the Sun once every 15˜years.197

Launch Date and Time:
 8 August 2001 / 16:13:40 UT
Launch Site: Cape Canaveral Air Force Station / 
SLC-17A
Scientific Instruments:1. solar wind ion monitor2. electron monitorResults: During its nearly two years in halo orbit around the SunŒEarth L1 point, the Genesis, the fifth Discovery-class spacecraft, was designed to collect samples of the solar wind and then sub-sequently return them to Earth. The collection device, fixed inside the return capsule, was made of a stack of four circular metallic trays, one that would be continuously exposed, and the other three deployed depending on particular solar wind characteristics. After insertion into a low parking 
orbit around Earth, the third stage fired exactly an hour after launch, at 17:13 UT on 8 August 2001 to 
send the spacecraft towards its destination at L1. On 16 November, a 4-minute. 28-second burn of 
its engine put Genesis into a halo orbit around L1 with a radius of about 800,000 kilometers and a period of six months. The first array was exposed for sample collecting a little over two weeks later on 30 November, while the others, depending on 
the particular array, were left exposed from 193 
days (coronal mass ejection collector) to 887 days (the bulk arrays). The prior record for a solar wind collector (on Apollo 16 in 1972) had been a short 
45 hours. All the trays were stowed away on 1 April 
2004, and exactly three weeks later, on 22 April, 
the spacecraft fired its four thrusters and began its long trek back via an unusual trajectory that took it 
past the Moon (at a range of 250,000 kilometers), Earth (at 392,300 kilometers), and then to L2, 
which it reached in July 2004. Swinging around L2 it headed in the direction of Earth. About 5.5 
hours prior to reentry on 8 September, the space
-craft bus ejected its return capsule and then fired its thrusters to enter a parking orbit around Earth partly as a precaution in case separation had not occurred. The capsule successfully separated 
and hit Earth™s atmosphere, experiencing a force 
216
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
of 27 g™s. The drogue parachute (which would 
have deployed the main chute) unfortunately did not deploy, and the capsule hit the ground at an 
estimated speed of 311 kilometers/hour at 15:58 UT on 8 September 2004. The ﬁlandingﬂ was, as designed, in the Dugway Proving Ground in the Utah Test and Training Range, but obviously the 
capsule was severely damaged and contaminated. The shattered sample canister was taken to a clean room and, over the subsequent month, disassem-bled carefully. Teams eventually tagged 15,000 
fragments of the return capsule. Despite the con-dition of the capsule, over a period of several years, project scientists were able to glean a significant amount of data from the recovered debris and pub-lished results detailing, for example, the identifica-tion of argon and neon isotopes in samples of three types of solar wind captured by the spacecraft. An investigation into the accident found that the drogue failed to deploy due to a design defect that allowed an incorrect orientation during assembly of gravity-switch devices that initiate deployment of the spacecraft™s drogue parachute and parafoil. The 
main Genesis bus meanwhile headed back to L1 and then entered heliocentric orbit. Contact was maintained until 16 December 2004.217

Scientific Instruments:1. remote imager/spectrograph (CRISP)2. forward imager (CFI)3.
 neutral gas ion mass spectrometer (NGIMS)4. dust analyzer (CIDA)
Results: This sixth Discovery-class mission (after 
Mars Pathfinder, NEAR, Lunar Prospector, 
Stardust, and Genesis) was designed to fly by at 
least two cometary nucleii with the goal of com-piling topographical and compositional maps, 
sending back imagery, and collecting data on 
the structure and composition of their comas. 
Named Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR), 
the spacecraft would carry out its principal mis-sion from heliocentric orbit with encounters with 
Comet 2P/Encke (on 12 November 2003), 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 (on 19 June 2006) 
and possibly, 6P/d™Arrest (16 August 2008). The 
spacecraft was successfully launched into a high 
apogee orbit (with a period of five-and-a-half 
days). Controllers implemented at least 23 orbital 
maneuvers over the next 43 days (and 25 orbits) 
to position CONTOUR properly for its planned 
burn to heliocentric orbit on 15˜August. On that 
day, at 08:49˜UT, its solid propellant apogee motor 
fired as the spacecraft was approaching peri-gee over the Indian Ocean and out of radio con-tact. Unfortunately, nothing was ever heard from 
CONTOUR again. Later investigation showed 
that the spacecraft had broken up during its burn. 
The spacecraft probably suffered structural fail-ure due to ﬁplume heatingﬂ as its main engine was 
firing, caused either by problems in the design of 
the probe or the solid rocket motor˜itself.219

2. near infrared spectrometer (NIRS)3. x-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRS)4. wide-range camera (ONC-W)5. telescopic camera (AMICA)
6. four ion thrustersResults: With this mission, Japan hoped to be the 
first nation to visit a minor planet and return sam-ples from it. The plan was for the spacecraft to 
launch in 2003, encounter its target in 2005, and 
then return to Earth, with a landing in the Woomera 
Test Range in South Australia in 2007. NASA 
had originally planned to supply a nano-rover for 
the mission but backed out from the mission in 
November 2000. Instead, ISAS built its own rover, 
called MINERVA (Micro/Nano Experimental 
Robot Vehicle for Asteroid), a 16-sided ﬁhopperﬂ 
that weighed only 600 grams and was equipped 
with six thermometers, a pair of stereoscopic cam-eras, and a short-focus camera. MUSES-C, named 
Hayabusa (or ﬁPeregrine falconﬂ) after launch, 
lifted off with MINERVA and was inserted directly 
into a solar orbit of 0.860 × 1.138 AU. Its goal, to 
rendezvous with asteroid 1998SF36 (now renamed 
Itokawa after the founding figure of the Japanese 
space program). During its outbound trip, control-lers operated its ion engines, although one (of a total 
of four) failed soon after launch. As per its mission 
profile, the spacecraft returned towards Earth for a 
gravity assist flyby on 19 May 2004 at a range of 
3,725 kilometers and then moved into a 1.01 × 1.73 
AU heliocentric orbit. Unfortunately, right after 
this, Hayabusa was caught in the aftermath of a 
massive solar eruption that degraded its solar cells 
(and thus power to its ion engines). Mission man-agers scrambled to come up with a new schedule, 
delayed now for both the asteroid encounter and 
return to Earth. As it approached in the direction of 
Itokawa, the spacecraft™s ion engines (one of which 
had operated for 10,400 hours) were shut off, and 
its main engine fired at 01:17 UT on 12 September 
2005 to terminate its ﬁapproach phase.ﬂ At the time, 
it was only 20 kilometers from its target. In its sta-tion-keeping mode, Hayabusa took hundreds of 
high resolution pictures, but by 3 October, two of its 
three reaction wheels controlling the attitude had 
failed. Yet, the spacecraft was able to conduct two 
ﬁrehearsalﬂ landings (on 4 and 9 November). During 
a third rehearsal, at a distance of about 55 meters, 
controllers commanded the mother ship to release 
MINERVA. Because tracking was being transferred 
from a Japanese antenna to a NASA one, key infor-mation was lacking about Hayabusa™s vertical speed. 
By the time the command reached Hayabusa, it 
was actually moving away at 15 meters/second. As 
a result, MINERVA missed its target and flew into 
heliocentric orbit. Remarkably, the little rover oper
-ated as planned for 18 hours. On 19 November, the 
main spacecraft successfully executed a descent run 
and landed softly at 21:09:32 UT at 6°˜S / 39°˜E in 
the middle of a feature named ﬁMUSES Sea.ﬂ The 
220BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
probe rebounded but settled down in a stable posi-tion by 21:41 UT. (The spacecraft was preceded by 
one of three target markers that had the names of 
880,00 people engraved on it). The spacecraft was, 
however, not properly aligned and took off at 22:15 
UT in what was the first ever liftoff from a celes
-tial body apart from Earth or the Moon. During a 
second landing at 22:07 UT on 25 November, the 
spacecraft was supposed to fire two small projectiles 
to generate a spray of soil for collection, but later 
data indicated this probably did not occur, although 
some material was clearly collected. Hayabusa 
immediately lifted off again, although it had suf-fered some damage during landing that caused a 
propellant leak in the attitude control system. This 
caused a cascade of problems including loss of solar 
orientation necessary for the spacecraft to have any 
power. With contact becoming rather intermittent, 
on 8 December tracking stations noted an abrupt 
change in attitude and a decrease in signal strength. 
At this point, Hayabusa was tumbling. Remarkably, 
controllers re-established contact (presumably after 
the tumbling had ceased when the leaking propellant 
had run out) on 23 January 2006. The spacecraft™s 
condition was dire but JAXA was able to revive a 
number of systems. A year later, on 17Œ18 January 
2007, the lid of the sample catcher was closed, and 
the catcher stowed into the return capsule. Finally, a 
plan to use its ion thrusters to return it to Earth was 
implemented: on 25 April 2007, two ion engines 
began to fire, continuing for about seven months. 
A second firing period began on 4 February 2009, 
designed to bring the spacecraft back to Earth. By 
this time, only one of the four thrusters was operable, 
which itself failed in November, leaving Hayabusa 
four months short of the firing time needed to get 
back to Earth. Japanese engineers came up with an 
ingenious solution, to use the ion source from one 
engine (engine B) with the neutralizer from another 
(engine A). The final phase of operation of the ion 
thruster concluded on 27 March 2010, followed by 
four short course corrections. On 13 June 2010, 
at a range of 40,000 kilometers from Earth, the 
spacecraft released its return capsule, just 3 hours 
before reaching Earth™s atmosphere. Both entered 
the atmosphere at 13:51 UT and began to deceler-ate. While the mother ship burned up as expected, 
the return capsule was unscathed. It deployed its 
parachute and landed just 500 meters from its target 
point in the Woomera Test Range in Australia at 
14:12 UT and was successfully recovered soon after. 
In November 2010, Japanese scientists announced 
that the return capsule had indeed returned 1,500 
grains of rock (most smaller in size than 10 microm-eters) from Itokawa, this being the second sample 
(after that from Genesis) returned from another 
celestial body other than the Moon.200

 Beagle 2:1. gas analysis package2. environmental sensors3. 2 stereoscopic cameras4. microscope5. Mössbauer spectrometer6. x-ray spectrometer7. planetary underground tool (PLUTO)Results: ESA™s first planetary mission (although 
launched by the Russians) had two parts, an 
orbiter and a lander. The orbiter was designed to 
image the entire surface of Mars in high resolu-tion, produce a map of the mineral composition of 
its surface, map the composition of its atmosphere, 
determine the structure of the sub-surface (to a 
depth of a few kilometers), and study the effects of 
the atmosphere on its surface as well as the inter-action of the atmosphere with the solar wind. It 
carried a number of instruments that were origi-nally on the ill-fated Russian Mars 8 probe; sev-eral other nations also contributed, including the 
U.S., Poland, Japan, and China. The 33.2-kilogram 
British Beagle 2 lander (its name, an allusion to 
the HMS Beagle that carried the young Charles 
Darwin (1809Œ1882) on his historic voyage) was 
designed to conduct exobiology research and geo-chemistry research on the Martian surface. Its sci-entific suite included a gas analysis package that 
used a set of 12 gas heating ovens to heat soil to 
study released gases. After launch, the Fregat stage 
ignited twice, first to Earth orbit and second (at 
19:03 UT) to send the spacecraft into heliocentric 
orbit. About 6 hours prior to entry into Mars orbit, 
at 08:31 UT on 19 December 2003, Mars Express 
successfully released Beagle 2, and without any 
active means of propulsion on board, it began its 
passive journey to the surface of Mars, landing 
as expected by 03:14 UT on 25˜December. The 
American 2001 Mars Odyssey was programmed 
to relay the first signals from Beagle but heard 
nothing. Mars Express meanwhile fired its main 
engine at 02:47 UT on Christmas Day and entered 
an initial Mars orbit of 260 × 187,500 kilometers 
(with a period of 10 days), ESA thus achieving 
what had only been accomplished before by the 
United States and Soviet Union. After about a 
hundred days, in early May, the orbiter was in a 
10,107 × 298-kilometer orbit with an orbital period 
of 6.7 hours. Attempts to contact Beagle 2 proved 
unsuccessful and the lander aspect of the mission 
was declared officially lost on 6 February 2004. In 
January 2015, ESA announced that high-resolution 
images taken by NASA™s Mars Reconnaissance 
Orbiter (MRO) showed Beagle 2™s wreckage on the 
Martian surface. The pictures revealed the lander 
partially deployed on the surface, confirming that 
entry, descent, and the landing sequence had gone 
well. Further improvement of these images by 
University College, London in the spring of 2016 
led researchers to conclude by October 2016 that 
Beagle 2 did indeed touch down softly on Mars and 
had possibly deployed three of its four solar panels. 
The malfunction that killed the mission more likely 
happened soon after landing rather than before. 
Undoubtedly, the lander™s development program 
was mismanaged with fatal shortcomings including 
insufficient testing of key systems. Mars Express 
meanwhile began to return valuable data on the Red 
Planet. It deployed the first of its two 20-meter long 
radar booms for the MARSIS experiment about a 
year later, on 4˜May 2005, the second one being 
deployed on 14 June. The two booms together 
created a 40-meter-long dipole antenna to operate 
the MARSIS experiment. The spacecraft returned 
spectacular images of the planet™s terrain; during 
its first Martian year, it had mapped one-quarter 
of the surface at a resolution of 20 meters per pixel 
in color and more than half of the surface at 50 
meters. Within its first five years in orbit, the space
-craft had discovered relatively recent evidence of 
volcanic and glacial processes and the presence of 
water ice below the surface. Mars Express mapped 
the various types of ice in the polar regions and 
determined the history of water abundance on 
Mars. One of its most striking discoveries has been 
to confirm the existence of Methane in the atmo-sphere (announced on 30˜March 2004), a presence 
independently confirmed by ground observations, 
222BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
but later clarified by data from Curiosity. The 
mission of Mars Express was first extended to October 2007, and then again to May 2009, far exceeding its original 687-Earth day lifetime. A 
further five extensions have followed since then, with the most recent one extending the mission to 
2016. During these extended missions, the space-craft aided the operation of future Mars probes such as NASA™s Phoenix lander (in 2008) and 
also collected data on Phobos. On 3 March 2010, for example, Mars Express passed by Phobos at a range of just 67 kilometers, the closest any space-craft had ever come to it by that time. This dis-tance was beaten on 29˜December 2013, when the 
spacecraft approached within just 45 kilometers of the Martian moon. Earlier, in August 2011, the 
probe ran into problems with its onboard computer memory and entered ﬁsafe modeﬂ twice in response 
to emergencies. Fortunately, by 24˜November 2011, 
controllers were able to bring the spacecraft back to full operating capacity. By the time of the 10th 
anniversary of its launch, ESA was able to release a near-complete topographical map of Mars showing 
the mountains, craters, ancient river beds, and lava flows that mark the planet. A potentially danger
-ous event for Mars Express was the flyby of Comet C/2013 A1 (also known as Siding Spring) near 
Mars on 19 October 2014. Because the range of the comet was only 385,000 kilometers, there were concerns about the possibility of the comet™s coma 
enveloping Mars and along with it, the operational spacecraft in the vicinity of Mars (including at that time, the American Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, 
2001 Mars Odyssey, MAVEN, the European Mars 
Express, and the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission). In February 2015, scientists announced, based 
on data from Mars Express and NASA™s MRO, 
that Phlegra Montes, a complex network of hills, 
ridges, and basins spanning 1,400 kilometers might hide large quantities of water-ice, perhaps only 20 
meters below the surface. During three years, the 
Mars Express team continued with an interest-ing media experiment using the simple low-res-olution camera originally designed to image the 
lost Beagle˜2 lander. After the search for Beagle 2 
concluded in 2003, that camera was switched off, but in 2007, ESA switched it back on, this time 
entirely for education and outreach. Images from the so-called Mars Webcam has been used by 
the public in dozens of countries, as enthusiasts 
downloaded, shared, and processed images, origi
-nally posted on a Flickr page. By May 2016, some 19,000 images, some of them based on requests from schools and youth clubs, had been viewed over two million times. In October 2016, Mars 
Express helped in the collection and transfer of data for the ill-fated Schiaparelli EDM lander that set down upon Mars. In November 2014, funding for the Mars Express mission was extended for the sixth time, to December 2016, and it continues to 
operate at full strength in mid-2017.201

suspected of having been affected by liquid water in the past. The plan was for the rovers to move 
from place to place and perform on-site geological 
investigations and take photographs with mast-
mounted cameras (about 1.5 meters off the ground) providing 360° stereoscopic views of the terrain. A 
suite of instruments (MB, APXS, the magnets, MI, 
and RAT) were deployed on a robotic arm (known 

as the Instrument Deployment Device, IDD). The 
arm would place the instruments directly against soil or rock and activate the instruments. The com-plete spacecraft was launched into an intermediate 

parking orbit around Earth of 163 × 4,762 kilome-ters at 28.5° inclination before the PAM-D upper 
stage fired to send it on to heliocentric orbit on a 
trajectory to intercept Mars. A mid-course correc
-
tion followed 10 days later. After three more cor
-rections, the spacecraft™s ﬁCruise Stageﬂ carrying 
the Spirit rover approached Mars for the landing on 4 January 2004. About 15 minutes prior to entry 

into the atmosphere, the lander (inside its protec-
tive aeroshell) separated from the Cruise Stage. At an altitude of 6 to 7.5 kilometers, a parachute deployed, followed 30 seconds later by release of 224BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
the aeroshell™s bottom heat shield. Within another 
10 seconds, the rover unreeled down a ﬁbridleﬂ (or tether) while still descending at a rate of 70 meters/second. Four massive airbags, of the same type as 
the ones used on Mars Pathfinder, inflated soon 
after, followed by firing of the retrorockets at the 
base of the parachute until the lander was about 8.5 meters off the ground. The retrorockets were needed since the Martian atmosphere is less than 1% the density of Earth, and parachutes alone cannot reduce velocity. The entire package hit 
the Martian landscape at 04:26 UT at a velocity of 14 meters/second, bouncing a total of 28 times before rolling to a stop about 250Œ300 meters from 
point of first impact. Landing coordinates were 14.5692°˜S / 175.4729° E, about 13.4 kilometers 
from the planned target, inside the Gusev crater. 
The area was henceforth known as the Columbia Memorial Station. Through it all, the lander trans-mitted data via Mars Global Surveyor. About an 
hour-and-a-half after impact and after deflation of 
the airbags, MER-A deployed its petal solar panels, now relaying information to Earth via 2001 Mars 
Odyssey. Immediately after, Spirit began to trans
-mit spectacular images back to Earth. The rover ran into a major problem on 21 January 2004 when NASA™s Deep Space Network lost contact. Due to 
a problem in Spirit™s flash memory subsystem, the 
rover entered a ﬁfault mode.ﬂ Fortunately, control
-lers were able to reformat the flash memory and send up a software patch (to preclude memory overload). Normal operations resumed again on 
5 February and the day after, Spirit used its Rock 
Abrasion Tool (RAT) to ground down the surface 
of a rock (called ﬁAdirondackﬂ), a feat performed for the very first time on Mars. Investigating the exposed interior allowed scientists import-ant insights into the composition of Martial soil. The original planned mission was to have lasted 90 Martian days (to approximately 4 April 2004). 
Yet, mission planners were able to repeatedly for
-mulate extended missions well beyond the rover™s 
original lifetime. Some of the subsequent high-lights included a visit to Bonneville Crater, about 
370 meters from its original landing point, then on to the base of Columbia Hills where it spent an extended period of time. By 2005, the rover began slowly making its way uphill to the apex of Hus-band Hill, over terrain that was both rocky and sandy. It stopped at many locations to investigate, 
often using the RAT. In March 2005, a peculiar and 
strange event, the passing of dust devils that swept dust from the top of the solar panels, increased 
power coming to Spirit from the usual 60% to 93%, 
thus significantly extending the lifetime of the mission. On 29 September 2005, the rover finally reached the summit of Husband Hill, a small flat plain, from which Spirit was able to take 360° pan
-oramas in real color of the Gusev Crater. Early the 
following year, the rover was directed to the north 
face of McCool Hill where it was assumed that 
Spirit would receive sufficient sunlight to maintain operations through the impending Martian winter. 
The trip to McCool Hill was eventually canceled partly because a front wheel had stopped working. This malfunction proved to be beneficial since the inactive wheel scraped off the upper layer of 
Martian soil as the rover moved, exposing bright 
silica-rich dust that indicated contact between soil and water. In early 2007, controllers passed 
on new software to both Spirit and Opportunity. 
These new programs allowed the rovers to auton-omously decide on a number of different actions, such as whether to transmit a particular image back to Earth or whether to extend the remote arm. Through much of the (Earth) summer of 
2007, however, both Spirit and Opportunity faced 
massive dust storms that eroded their ability to operate effectively, mainly due to lack of power 
generated from the solar panels. These concerns did not abate into 2008 as another winter storm at the end of that year further reduced the output of Spirit™s solar panel to about 89 watt-hours per 
Martian day (where a nominal amount would be about 700 watt-hours per day). At such low levels, 
the rover needed to resort to using its own batteries which, if ran dry, would basically end the mission. 
Through 2009, a series of fortuitous eventsŠsuch 2252003
 as wind that blew dust off the panelsŠslowly increased power generated by the solar panels. By April 2009, the rover was back to about 372 watt hours per day, sufficient for ﬁnormalﬂ science activ
-ities to resume. Unfortunately, soon after, on 1 May 
2009, while driving south beside the western edge of a low plateau called Home Plate, Spirit was ren-dered immobile in soft soil, its wheels unable to generate traction against the ground. Subsequently, 
on 28 November, another of Spirit™s six wheels, the 
right rear one, stopped working. By late January 
2010, after many attempts to move Spirit had not 
bore fruit, mission planners reformulated the Spirit 
mission as a ﬁstationary science platform.ﬂ One of 
its goals would now be to study the tiny wobbles in Mars™ rotation to determine the nature of the plan
-et™s coreŠwhether it is liquid or solid. In order to 
do that, however, the rover had to be tilted slightly 
to the north to expose its panels to the Sun, since 
the winter sun would be in the northern sky. In the 
end, the desired tilt was not achieved, and after 
22˜March 2010, JPL was not able to regain contact 
with Spirit again. Despite more than 1,300 com
-mands sent to Spirit, NASA officially concluded its recovery efforts on 25 May 2011. The most prob-able cause of the loss of contact was the excessive cold that made its survival heaters ineffective. By the time it stopped, Spirit had traveled 7.73 kilo
-meters across the Martian plains. It had operated for 6 years, 2 months, and 19 days, more than 25 times its original intended lifetime.202Opportunity

Results: For description and background, see entry 
for Spirit. After launch, the MER-1 rover was dis
-patched on its six-month trek to Mars. After a final 
course correction on 16 January 2004, the space-craft dived into the Martian atmosphere on 
25˜January 2004. The descent to the surface was 
uneventful with no anomalies. The lander, enclosed 
in the airbags, touched down at 04:54 UT and then bounced at least 26 times before coming to rest in Meridiani Planum at 1.9483° S / 354.47417° E, about 14.9 kilometers from the intended target. This area was now named the Challenger Memorial Station, in tribute to the Space Shuttle crew lost in 
1986. Opportunity landed in a relatively flat plain but within an impact crater known as Eagle. After 
extensive studies within Eagle, on 22 March 2004, Opportunity climbed up the edge of the crater and rolled out and headed for a new phase of its mis-sion in Endurance Crater, about 750 meters away. 
Having exited Eagle, the rover took some spectacu-lar shots of the abandoned area where the lander, 
backshell, and parachute were still visible. Near its discarded heat shield, Opportunity discovered an unusual basketball-sized rock in January 2005 
(known as ﬁHeat Shield Rockﬂ) that turned out to be an iron-nickel meteorite. Later that year, the 
rover drove into an area where several of its wheels were buried in sand, rendering the vehicle immo-bile. JPL controllers were able to maneuver the vehicle a few centimeters at a time and free 226BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Opportunity in June 2005 after six weeks of rest. Through the remainder of the year and into 2006, the rover headed slowly in a southward direction towards the 800-meter diameter Victoria crater, 
first arriving at Erebus, a highly eroded impact 
crater about 300 meters in diameter. In March 
2006, it then began its 2- kilometer journey to Victoria, a crater wider and deeper than any yet 
examined by the two rovers. After a 21-month trip, 
Opportunity arrived at Victoria in September 2006 
and sent back striking pictures of its rim. The fol-lowing year, 2007, was an important test for 
Opportunity given the severe dust storms that plagued Mars. By 18 July, the rover™s solar panels 
were reporting power at only 128 watt hours, the lowest for either rover at that point. All science 
activities were indefinitely suspended for Opportunity which faced much more severe condi-tions than Spirit. After about six weeks and abate
-ment of the dust storms, Opportunity was back in 
action, and on 11˜September 2007, it entered 
Victoria Crater, staying inside for almost a year 
sending back a wealth of information on its soil. Opportunity™s next target was the enormous 
Endeavour Crater, 22 kilometers in diameter. On 
the way there, the rover found the so-called 
Marquette Island rock, ﬁdifferent in composition 
and character from any known rock on Mars or 
meteorite from Mars,ﬂ according to Steve Squyres 
(1956Œ ), the principal investigator for the rovers. 
The rock appeared to have originated deep in the 
Martian crust and someplace far away from the 
landing site, unlike almost all the rocks previously 
studied by Opportunity. On 24 March 2010, 
Opportunity passed the 20-kilometer milestone on 
Mars, more than double the distance recorded by 
Spirit, and far in excess of what was originally con-sidered a nominal missionŠ600 meters. Two 
months later, on 20 MayŠwith Spirit already inac
-tiveŠOpportunity broke the record set by the 
Viking 1 Lander for the longest continuous opera
-tion on the surface of Mars, 6 years and 116 days. 
Another milestone was passed when Opportunity, 
still heading towards Endeavour Crater, passed the 
30-kilometer mark on 1 June 2011. Finally, after a 
journey of nearly three years and about 21 kilome-ters, Opportunity arrived at Endeavour crater on 
9˜August 2011. In September 2011, NASA 
announced that an aluminum cuff that served as a 
cable shield on each of the RATs on the rovers was 
made from aluminum recovered from the World 
Trade Center towers, destroyed during the terrorist 
attacks on 11 September 2001. Honeybee Robotics, 
which helped build the tool, had its offices in New 
York that day not far from the attacks. As a memo
-rial to the victims, JPL and Honeybee worked 
together to include the aluminum on the Mars 
rovers. Through late 2012 and into 2013, 
Opportunity worked around a geographic feature 
named Matijevic Hill (which overlooks the 
Endeavour crater), analyzing rocks and soil. On 
16˜May 2013, NASA announced that Endeavour 
had passed the previous record for the farthest dis-tance traveled by any NASA vehicle on another 
celestial body, 35.744 kilometers, a record set by 
the Apollo 17 Lunar Roving Vehicle in December 
1972. By August 2013, Opportunity was at Solander 
Point, an area of contact between a rock layer that 
was formed in acidic wet conditions long before 
and an older one from a more ﬁneutralﬂ environ-ment. Both Cape York (location of Matijevic Hill) 
and Solander Point are raised segments near the 
western rim of the Endeavour crater. On 4˜January 
2014, Opportunity passed 10 years on the surface 
of Mars, now with relatively clean surfaces on the 
solar panels that had allowed increased power to 
the rover. A ﬁselfieﬂ from March 2014 showed a 
rover cleaned by wind events earlier in the month 
that raised hopes for continuing the mission. As it 
continued its exploration mission on the Martian 
surface, on 28 July 2014, NASA announced that 
Opportunity had passed the distance record set on 
another celestial body, set by Lunokhod 2, when 
the American rover™s odometer showed 40.25 kilo
-meters, exceeding the Soviet vehicle™s record of 39 
kilometers. However, Russian analysis from LRO 
images suggest that Lunokhod˜2 may have traveled 
as much as 42 kilometers, rather than the revised 
2272003
 39 (itself a ﬁrevisionﬂ up from 37 kilometers). While 
the rover was generally in good health, because of 
the large number of computer resets in the preced-ing month, which interfered with its science goals, 
mission planners implemented a complete refor-mat of its flash memory on 4 September 2014. The 
same day, NASA announced a further (ninth) 
extension of the mission of Opportunity to another 
two years with a mission to nearby Marathon Valley. 
At the beginning of September, it had covered 
40.69 kilometers. At launch, like its sister rover, 
Spirit, Opportunity was designed to have a lifetime 
of 90 sols (Martian days)Šabout three Earth 
months. In December 2014, NASA announced 
that the rover had been plagued with problems 
with saving telemetry information into its 
ﬁnon-volatileﬂ (or flash) memory, a problem traced 
to one of its seven memory banks (Bank 7). By May 
2015, NASA controllers configured the memory so 
the rover was operating only in RAM-only mode. 
On 25 March 2015, NASA announced that, having 
traveled 42.195 kilometers (or 26.219 miles), 
Opportunity became ﬁthe first human enterprise to 
exceed marathon distance of travel on another 
world.ﬂ In June 2015, because Mars passed almost 
directly behind the Sun (from Earth™s perspective) 
and therefore communications were curtailed. 
Later, through its seventh Martian winter (during 
Earth winter 2015Œ2016), at a time when it was 
kept at ﬁenergy-minimumﬂ levels due to the relative 
lack of solar energy, Opportunity kept busy, using 
its Rock Abration Tool to remove surface dust from 
a target called ﬁPrivate John Potts,ﬂ the name a ref
-erence to a member of the Lewis and Clark 
Expedition. During this period, Opportunity con-tinued to explore the western rim of the 22-kilometer 
wide Endeavour crater, particularly the southern 
side of Marathon Valley, which slices through 
Endeavour crater™s rim from west to east. On 
10˜March 2016, while making its closest approach 
to a target near the crest of Knudsen Crater, it 
drove at a tilt of 32°, breaking the record for the 
steepest slope driven by any rover on Mars (a record 
previously set by Opportunity during a climb in 
January 2004). In October 2016, Opportunity 
began a two-year extended mission that is to 
include investigations in the ﬁBitterroot Valleyﬂ por
-tion of the western rim of the Endeavour Crater. 
The plan is for the rover to travel into a gully that 
slices Endeavor and is about two football fields in 
length. Opportunity Principal Investigator Steve 
Squyres noted that scientists were ﬁconfident [that] 
this is a fluid-carved gully, and that water was 
involved.ﬂ On 7 February 2017, Opportunity passed 
the 44-kilometer mark on its odometer, as it made 
slow progress towards its next major scientific 
objective, a gully named Perseverance Valley, which 
it reached by the first week of May. Having col
-lected several panoramas of high-value targets in 
the gully, on 4˜June, the rover experienced a prob
-lem due to a stall on the left front wheel, which left 
the wheel ﬁtoed outﬂ by 33 degrees. Fortunately, 
after several straightening attempts, the wheel 
appeared to be steering straight again, although 
controllers could identify any conclusive cause for 
the problem. For about three weeks during June 
and July, there was reduced communication with 
the rover due to a solar conjunction (when the Sun 
comes between Earth and Mars). In mid-July, 
Opportunity finally entered Perseverance Valley 
and began driving down into the gully during which 
time, rover energy levels dropped due to reduced 
Sun exposure. As of 31˜October 2017, Opportunity™s 
odometer read 45.04 kilometers.203SIRTF / Spitzer Space Telescope

Launch Site: Cape Canaveral Air Force Station / 
SLC-17B
Scientific Instruments:1. infrared array camera (IRAC)2. infrared spectrograph (IRS)3. multiband imaging photometer for Spitzer (MIPS)Results: SIRTF was the fourth and last of NASA™s 
ﬁGreat Observatories,ﬂ after the Hubble Space 
Telescope (launched in 1990), the Compton 
Gamma Ray Observatory (1991), and the Chan-dra X-Ray Observatory (1999). It carried an 
85-centimeter infrared telescope and three scien
-tific instruments as part of the Cryogenic Telescope 
Assembly (CTA). Its planned two-and-a-half-year 
mission was designed to detect infrared radiation 
from its vantage point in heliocentric orbit. The 

CTA was cooled to only 5 degrees above absolute 

zero (or a temperature of Œ268°C) using 360 liters 
of liquid helium, ensuring that the observatory™s 
ﬁbody heatﬂ did not interfere with the observa-tion of relatively cold cosmic objects. The Delta 

II Heavy (in a two-stage Delta 7925H configura-tion) inserted the second stage and payload into 

an initial orbit of 166 × 167 kilometers at 31.5° 

before the second stage ignited again at 06:13 UT 

on 25 August 2003 to send both the stage and the 
observatory into a hyperbolic orbit where SIRTF, 
by 3 September passed into an ﬁEarth-trailing 

orbitﬂ around the Sun. It ejected its dust cover on 

29 August and then opened its aperture door the 

day after. In this orbit, at 0.996 × 1.019 AU, Earth 
(rather prominent in the infrared) does not hinder 
observation of potential targets of observation. 

On 18 December 2003, the SIRTF was renamed 

the Spitzer Space Telescope in honor of Lyman S. 
Spitzer, Jr. (1914Œ1997), one of the first to pro
-pose the idea of using telescopes in space. One of 
the early successes of the mission (in 2005) was 

to capture direct light from extrasolar planets for 
the first time. Many other findings followed in the 
subsequent four years, including seeing the light 

from the earliest objects in the universe, map-ping the weather on an extrasolar planet for the 
first time, finding water vapor on another extraso-lar planet, and identifying a new ring (the Phoebe 
ring) around Saturn. The observatory worked 

far longer than expected and its supply of liquid 
helium finally depleted at 22:11 UT on 15 May 
2009, nearly six years after launch. At that point, 

mission scientists reformulated the mission as the 

Spitzer Warm Mission, which would use the two 

shortest-wavelength modules of the IRAC instru-ment, which did not require the cryogenic helium 

to operate, for future observations. More discov-eries followed. In August 2010, for example, data 

from Spitzer revealed the identification of the first 
Carbon-rich planet (known as WASP-12b) orbiting 
a star. In October 2012, astronomers announced 
2292003
 that data from the observatory had allowed a more 
precise measurement of the Hubble constant, the 
rate at which the universe is stretching apart. The 
following year, Spitzer celebrated 10 full years 
of operation in space and continued operation 
of its two instruments which, in August 2014, 
observed an eruption of dust around a star (NGC 
2547-ID8), possibly caused by a collision of large 
asteroids. Such impacts are thought to lead to the 
formation of planets. Continuing discoveries based 
on results from Spitzer (as well as data integrated 
with information from other space-based observa-tories such as Swift) were announced in April 2015 
(discovery of one of the most distant planets ever 
identified, about 13,000 light-years from Earth) 
and in March 2016 (discovery of the most remote 
galaxy ever detected, a high-redshift galaxy known 
as GN-z11). The latter was detected as part of the 
Frontiers Field project that combines the power of 
all three of NASA™s Great Observatories, Spitzer, 
Hubble, and Chandra. In August 2016, mission 
planners at JPL announced a new phase of the 
Spitzer mission known simply as ﬁBeyond,ﬂ lever-aged on a two-and-a-half-year mission extension 
granted by NASA earlier in the year. Because the 
distance between Spitzer and Earth has widened 
over time, during Beyond, its antenna must be 
pointed at higher angles towards the Sun to com
-municate with Earth. As a result, parts of the space
-craft will experience increasing amounts of heat. 
Simultaneously, its solar panels will be pointed 
away from the Sun in this configuration, thus put
-ting onboard batteries under more stress. These 
challenges will be a part of the Beyond phase as 
Spitzer continues to explore planetary bodies both 
within and beyond the solar system. In October 
2017, NASA announced that it was seeking infor-mation from potential funders who might be able 
to support operation of the telescope after NASA 
funding runs out in March 2019. With such possi
-ble funding, it might be possible to operate Spitzer 
beyond September of that year when operations 
are expected to cease with government˜funding.204SMART-1

Results: The Small Missions for Advanced Research 
in Technology (SMART)-1 spacecraft was a tech
-nology demonstrator designed to test solar-electric 
propulsion and other deep space technologies on the way to the Moon. A second part of the mission 
would focus on studying polar mountain peaks that are in perpetual sunlight as well as the dark parts of the lunar parts that might contain ice. The ESA spacecraft, the first European spacecraft to enter orbit around the Moon, had a French-built Hall 
effect thruster (known as PPS®1350) derived from a Russian ion propulsion system originally designed by OKB Fakel, a Russian company that specializes 
in attitude control thrusters using ion and plasma 
sources. The thruster used xenon propellant to gen-erate 88 mN of thrust (about the weight of a post
-card) and a specific impulse of 1,650 seconds. The 
230BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
engine was powered by solar arrays which generated 
the 1,350 watts needed to power the ion engines. 
Initially launched into a geostationary transfer 
orbit of 7,035 × 42,223 kilometers by the Ariane 
5 hypergolic EPS upper stage (with a 2,600 kgf 
thrust Aestus engine), SMART-1 used its electric 
propulsion system to slowly spin out into higher and 
higher elliptical orbits in what was a highly efficient 
mission profile. Two days every week, mission con
-trollers at the European Space Operations Centre 
(ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, repeated burns of 
the ion engine, gradually expanding the spacecraft™s 
spiral orbit. By the time it was 200,000 kilometers 
out, the Moon™s gravity began to exert a significant 
influence on SMART-1. Nine days after its last per
-igee (on 2 November 2004), the spacecraft passed 
through the L1 Lagrange Point into a region domi
-nated by the Moon™s gravitational field. At 17:47 UT 
on 15 November, the vehicle then passed through 
its first perilune, having moved into polar orbit 
around the Moon. Initial orbital parameters were 
6,704 × 53,208 kilometers, with an orbital period 
of 129 hours. During the following weeks, SMART-
1™s ion engine fired to gradually reduce orbital 
parameters to allow closer views of the surface; it 
reached its operational orbit (with an orbital period 
of about 5 hours) by 27 February 2005. While in 
orbit, SMART-1™s instruments studied the Moon™s 
topography and surface texture as well as map-ping the surface distribution of minerals such as 
pyroxenes, olivines, and feldspars, thus improving 
the data returned by Clementine. The mission was 
designed to end in August 2005 but was extended 
a year to August 2006 with plans for an impact. On 
17 September 2005, the ion engine was fired for the 
last time, having exhausted all its propellant, leav-ing the vehicle in a natural orbit determined only 
by lunar gravity (and the gravitational influences 
of Earth and the Sun) and the occasional use of 
its attitude control thrusters. By that time, the ion 
engine had fired for 4,958.3 hours, a record length 
of operation in space for such an engine. The mis-sion of SMART-1 finally ended at 05:42:22 UT on 
3 September 2006 when the spacecraft was delib-erately crashed onto the nearside of the Moon in 
Lacus Excellentiaie at 46.2° W / 34.3° S. Its impact 
(at 2 kilometers/second) created a dust cloud visible 
with Earth-based telescopes.2312004

includes SOHO (launched 1995), XMM-Newton (1999), Cluster II (2000), and INTEGRAL (2002), Rosetta consists of two partsŠan orbiter (Rosetta) and a lander (Philae)Šeach equipped with a vari-ety of scientific instruments. Originally, the mis
-sion was targeting comet 46P/Wirtanen but when 
the launch was delayed due to problems with the 
Ariane 5, the mission was redirected to Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta was launched into an escape trajectory with a 17-minute burn of Ariane™s EPS 
second stage, putting the spacecraft on a trajectory that culminated in a 0.885 × 1.094 AU heliocentric 
orbit inclined at 0.4° to the ecliptic. Its voyage to its target comet was punctuated by a series of grav-ity-assist maneuvers, the first of which occurred at 22:09 UT on 4 March 2005 when Rosetta flew by Earth (over the Pacific, west of Mexico) at a dis
-tance of 1,954.7 kilometers. A most risky flyby of 
Mars followed on 25 February 2007, when Rosetta 
came a mere 250 kilometers close to the Red 232BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Planet, experiencing a short and critical period out 
of contact with Earth and in Mars™ shadow. Both 
these flybys produced spectacular photographs of 
Earth and Mars, respectively. The assist sent the 
spacecraft towards Earth for a second time, arriv-ing and flying past our planet at a range of 5,295 
kilometers on 13 November 2007. Before the final 
Earth flyby (on 12 November 2009), Rosetta per-formed a close flyby (just 800 kilometers) of aster-oid 2867 Steins in the main asteroid belt at 18:58 
UT on 5 September 2008, collecting a large 
amount of information. A second asteroid flyby, 
that of 21 Lutetia at 16:10 UT on 10 July 2010 at 
a range of 3,162 kilometers, produced spectacular 
images (using the OSIRIS instrument) of a bat-tered minor planet riddled with craters. Resolution 
was as high as 60 meters in a body whose longest 
side is around 130 kilometers. Soon after, in June 
2011, Rosetta was placed under ﬁhibernationﬂ as it 
made its way beyond the orbit of JupiterŠwhere 
there was no solar energy to power the vehicleŠ
and back again close to the Sun. On 20 January 
2014, its internal clock ﬁawokeﬂ the spacecraft and 
sent a signal back to Earth that all was well. Now 
only 9 million kilometers from its primary target, 
Rosetta began its final race to comet 67P/C-G. On 
6 August 2014, at a distance of 405 million kilo
-meters from Earth (about halfway between the 
orbits of Mars and Jupiter), Rosetta finally rendez-voused with the comet as it completed the last of 
10 maneuvers (that began in May 2014) to adjust 
velocity and direction. During close operations 
near the comet, on 15 September, scientists iden
-tified a landing site for the spacecraft, ﬁSite Jﬂ 
(later named ﬁAgilkiaﬂ), located near the smaller of 
the comet™s two ﬁlobes.ﬂ By this time (10 September 
2014), the spacecraft was in a roughly 29-kilometer 
orbit around 67P/C-G, becoming the first space-craft to orbit a cometary nucleus. Just prior to the 
planned landing, on 12˜November, controllers 
identified a problem in Philae™s active descent 
system thruster which provides thrust to avoid a 
rebound, but it was decided to move on with the 
landing and rely only on the harpoons instead of 
the thruster to keep the spacecraft moored. At 
08:35 UT on 12 November, the two spacecraft 
separated, initiating Philae™s 7-hour descent to the 
comet at a relatively velocity of just 1 meter/
second. A signal confirming the touchdown arrived 
at Earth at 16:03 UT (about 28 minutes, 20 sec-onds after the actual event). It later transpired the 
Philae had actually landed three times on the 
comet (at 15:34:04, 17:25:26, and 17:31:17 UT 
comet time) as the two harpoons did not fire as 
intended after each touchdown. Later analysis 
showed that all of the three methods to secure the 
lander had faced some problems: the ice screws, 
which were designed for soft materials, did not 
penetrate the hard surface of the Agilkia region; 
the thruster failed to fire due to a problem with a 
seal; and the harpoons also did not fire due to an 
electrical problem. As a result, Philae bounced on 
the surface several times before settling down 
about one kilometer away from its intended land-ing site in an area known as Abydos. All of its 
instruments were subsequently activated for data 
collection. For a short period, ESA controllers did 
not know the disposition of the lander as it went 
into hibernation, but on 14 November, contact 
was reestablished with Philae, following which all 
of its collected data was transferred to the mother-ship. Due to exhaustion of the primary battery, last 
contact with Philae was at 00:36 UT on 
15˜November, thus coming to about 64 hours of 
independent operation (and 57 hours on the sur
-face). During its mission, Philae completed 80% of 
its planned ﬁfirst science sequence,ﬂ returning 
spectacular images of its surroundings, showing a 
cometary surface covered by dust and debris in 
size measuring anywhere from a millimeter to a 
meter. Philae also found complex molecules that 
could be the key building blocks of life, monitored 
the daily rise and fall of temperature, and assessed 
the surface properties and internal structure of the 
comet. ESA controllers hoped that the lander 
could be revived in August 2015 when sunlight fell 
on the lander and its solar panels, but assumed 
that Philae™s mission was essentially over by 
2332004
 November 2014. As hoped, the Philae lander was 
awoken after seven months of hibernation. At 
20:28 UT on 13 June 2015, controllers at ESA™s 
European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt 
received signals (about 663 kbits of data over 85 
seconds) from the lander, suggesting at least ini
-tially that Philae was ﬁdoing very wellﬂ and ﬁready 
for operations,ﬂ according to DLR Philae Project 
Manager Stephan Ulamec. A second smaller burst 
was received at 21:26 UT on 14 June followed by 
six more bursts by 9 July 2015, after which time 
Rosetta was no longer in range to receive data from 
Philae. A year after landing, in November 2015, 
mission teams still remained hopeful that there 
would be renewed contact with the lander, espe
-cially as the Rosetta orbiter began to approach the 
lander again. But in February 2016, ESA 
announced that it was unlikely that Rosetta would 
ever pick up any more signals from Philae again, 
partly due to failures in a transmitter and a receiver 
on board. On 5 September 2016, ESA announced 
that they had conclusively identified the landing 
site of Philae in images taken by Rosetta™s OSIRIS 
narrow-angle camera when the orbiter approached 
to just 2.7 kilometers of the surface. Rosetta, 
meanwhile, had continued its primary mission 
orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as 
the comet itself arced closer to the Sun. In 
November 2014, the orbiter adjusted its orbit sev-eral times to position it about 30 kilometers above 
the comet, interrupted by a brief ﬁdipﬂ down to 20 
kilometers for about 10 days in early December. 
On 4 February 2015, Rosetta began moving into a 
new path for an encounter, timed for 12:41 UT on 
14 February, at a range of just six kilometers. The 
flyby took the spacecraft over the most active 
regions of the comet, allowing scientists to seek 
zones where gas and dust accelerates from the sur-face. In June 2015, ESA extended Rosetta™s mis
-sion to at least September 2016 (an extension of 
nine months from its original ﬁnominalﬂ mission). 
During this extension, Rosetta was party to Comet 
67P/C-G™s closest approach to the Sun, a distance 
of 186 million kilometers, on 13 August 2015. At 
the perihelion, gases and dust particles around the 
comet reached peak intensity, clearly visible in the 
many spectacular images sent back by the orbiter. 
Finally, at 20:50 UT on 30 September 2016, 
Rosetta carried out a final maneuver sending it on 
a collision course with the comet from a height of 
19 kilometers. During the descent, Rosetta stud
-ied the comet™s gas, dust, and plasma environment 
very close to the surface and took numerous 
high-resolution images. The decision to end the 
mission was predicated on the fact that the comet 
was heading out beyond the orbit of Jupiter again, 
and thus, there would be little power to operate 
the spacecraft. Confirmation of final impact 
arrived at Darmstadt at 11:19:37 UT on 
30˜September 2016, thus ending one of ESA™s 
most successful planetary missions. Besides col-lecting a vast amount of data on the properties of 
the comet, including its interior, surface and sur
-rounding gas, dust, and plasma, Rosetta™s key find
-ings include the discovery of water vapor in comet 
67P/G-C (vapor that is significantly different from 
that found on Earth), the detection of both molec-ular nitrogen and molecular oxygen for the first 
time at a comet, the existence of exposed water ice 
on the comet™s surface, and the discovery of amino 
acid glycine (commonly found in proteins) and 
phosphorus (a component of DNA and cell mem-branes) in the comet.206MESSENGERNation: USA (84)

Mercury laser altimeter (MLA)7. Mercury atmospheric and surface composi-tion spectrometer (MASCS)8. energetic particle and plasma spectrometer (EPPS)9. radio science experiment (RS)Results: MESSENGER (Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging) was 
the seventh Discovery-class mission, and the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. Its primary goal was 
to study the geology, magnetic field, and chemical 

composition of the planet. It was the first mis-sion to Mercury after Mariner 10, more than 30 years before. MESSENGER was launched into an initial parking orbit around Earth after which 
its PAM-D solid motor fired to put the spacecraft 
on an escape trajectory into heliocentric orbit at 
0.92 × 1.08 AU and 6.4° inclination to the eclip
-tic. The six-and-a-half-year road to Mercury was 
punctuated by several gravity-assist maneuvers 
through the inner solar system, including one flyby 

of Earth (on 2˜August 2005), two flybys of Venus 

(on 24˜October 2006 and 5 June 2007), and three 
flybys of Mercury (on 14 January 2008, 6 October 2008, and 29 September 2009). The gravity-assist 
maneuvers allowed the spacecraft to overcome the 
problem of massive acceleration that accompanies flight toward the Sun; instead, the flybys helped to decelerate MESSENGER™s velocity relative to 

Mercury and also conserve propellant for its orbital 

mission (although it prolonged the length of the 
trip). The Earth flyby allowed mission controllers to properly calibrate all of the spacecraft™s instru
-ments while also returning spectacular images of the EarthŒMoon system. During the second 
Venusian flyby (at a range of only 338 kilometers), 
MESSENGER relayed back a vast amount of data, including visible and near-infrared imaging data on 

the upper atmosphere. Some of the investigations, 
especially its study of the particle-and-fields char
-acteristics of the planet, were coordinated with 
ESA™s Venus Express mission. The three Mercury 

flybys further slowed down the spacecraft, although 
during the last encounter in September 2009, MESSENGER entered a ﬁsafe modeﬂ and, as a result, collected no data on Mercury. Fortunately, 

the spacecraft revived 7 hours later. MESSENGER 

finally entered orbit around Mercury at 00:45 UT 18 March 2011, nearly seven years after launch and began formal data collection on 4 April. The 

vehicle™s orbit was highly elliptical, approximately 

9,300 × 200 kilometers with a 12-hour orbital 
period. One of MESSENGER™s most remarkable 
images was its mosaic of the Solar System, obtained on 18˜February 2011 with all the planets visible 

except Uranus and Neptune, a visual counterpart 
to the image of the solar system taken by Voyager˜1 
on 14˜February 1990. The spacecraft completed 
its primary year-long mission on 17 March 2012, 

having taken nearly 100,000 images of the surface 2352004
 of Mercury. Among its initial discoveries was find
-ing high concentrations of magnesium and calcium 
on Mercury™s nightside, identifying a significant 
northward offset of Mercury™s magnetic field from 
the planet™s center, finding large amounts of water 
in Mercury™s exosphere, and revealing evidence of 
past volcanic activity on the surface. In November 
2011, NASA announced that MESSENGER™s 
mission would be extended by a year, thus allow
-ing the spacecraft to monitor the solar maxi-mum in 2012. The extended mission lasted from 
18˜March 2012 to 17 March 2013. During this 
phase, by 20 April, with the help of three engine 
firings, the orbital period was reduced to 8 hours. 
It was also during this period, in early May 2012, 
that MESSENGER took its 100,000th photo-graph from orbit. By this time, the imaging instru-ment had globally mapped in both high-resolution 
monochrome and color, the entire surface of the 
planet. It was during this first extended mission 
that the spacecraft found evidence of water ice at 
Mercury™s poles, frozen at locations that never see 
sunlight (made possible by the fact that the tilt of 
Mercury™s rotational axis is almost zero.) A second 
extension was soon granted that extended the 
mission to March 2015, and on 6 February 2014, 
NASA reported that MESSENGER had taken 
its 200,000th orbital image, far exceeding the 
original expectation of at least 1,000 photographs. 
During the second extension, MESSENGER 
photographed two comets: Comet 2P/Encke and 
Comet C/2012 S1 (also known as Comet ISON). 
Beginning the summer of 2014, controllers began 
moving MESSENGER gradually, burn by burn, to 
a very low orbit for a new research program. By 
12˜September 2014, just after the 10th anniver
-sary of its launch, the spacecraft™s orbit was down 
to a mere 25 kilometers. Since then, mission con-trollers implemented at least two orbital maneu-vers (on 12 September and 24 October) to raise 
its orbit and continue its latest extended mission. 
By Christmas Day 2014, it was clear that the 
spacecraft™s propellants were running out and that 
MESSENGER would impact the planet in late 
March 2015. On 21 January 2015, mission con-trollers carried out one last maneuver to raise the 
spacecraft™s orbit sufficient to continue more sci
-ence activities to early in the spring. On 16 April 
2015, NASA announced that the spacecraft would 
impact the surface of Mercury by 30 April after it 
ran out of propellant. As scheduled, on that day, at 
19:26 UT, MESSENGER slammed into the plan
-et™s surface at about 14,080 kilometers/hour, cre
-ating a new crater on Mercury. Impact coordinates 
were probably close to 54.4° N / 149.9° W, near 
the Janácek crater in Suisei Planitia.2372005

Scientific Instruments:Flyby Spacecraft:1. high resolution instrument (HRI)2. medium resolution instrument (MRI)Impactor:1. impact or targeting sensor (ITS)Results: Unlike previous cometary flyby missions, such as Vega, Giotto, and Stardust, the Deep 
Impact spacecraft, the eighth mission in NASA™s 
Discovery program, was intended to study the inte-rior composition of a comet by deploying an impact probe that would collide with its target. The space-craft comprised two distinct parts, a flyby bus and an impactor. The former, weighing 601 kilograms, 
was solar powered and carried two primary instru-ments. The HRI, the main science camera for Deep Impact, was one of the largest space-based instru
-ments ever built for planetary science. It combined a visible-light multi-spectral CCD camera (with a filter wheel) and an imaging infrared spectrometer called the Spectral Imaging Module (SIM). The 
MRI was the functional backup for the HRI, and like the HRI, it also served as a navigation aid for 
Deep Impact. The 372-kilogram Impactor carried 
the ITS, nearly identical to the MRI, but without the filter wheel, which was designed to measure the Impactor™s trajectory and to image the comet 
from close range before impact. One of the more 
unusual payloads on board was a mini-CD with the names of 625,000 people collected as part of a campaign to ﬁSend Your Name to a Comet!ﬂ 
After launch, Deep Impact was put into low Earth orbit, then an elliptical orbit (163 × 4,170 kilome-ters), and after a third stage burn, the spacecraft and its PAM-D upper stage departed on an Earth 
escape trajectory. There were some initial moments 
of anxiety when it was discovered that the space-craft had automatically entered ﬁsafe modeﬂ shortly after entering heliocentric orbit, but by 13 January, 
Deep Impact returned to full operational mode following a program to ﬁtumbleﬂ the vehicle using 
its thrusters. The spacecraft traveled 429 million kilometers for nearly six months (including course corrections on 11 February and 4 May 2005) on an 
encounter with Comet 9P/Tempel. As the space
-craft approached its target, it spotted two outbursts of activity from the comet, on 14 June and 22˜June 
2005. At 06:00 UT (or 06:07 UT Earth-receive 
time) on 3 July 2005, Deep Impact released the Impactor probe, which, using small thrusters, moved into the path of the comet, where it hit the 
following day, 4 July at 05:44:58 UT at a relative 
velocity of 37,000 kilometers/hour. The impact 
generated an explosion the equivalent of 4.7 tons of TNT and a crater estimated to be about 150 meters in diameter. Minutes after the impact, the Flyby 
probe passed the nucleus at a range of about 500 kilometers at 05:59 UT on 3 July and took images 
of the resultant crater (although it was obscured by the dust cloud), ejecta plume, and the entire nucleus. Simultaneous observations of the impact were coordinated with ground-based observatories 238BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
as well as space-based ones, such as the European 
Rosetta (which was about 80 million kilometers from the comet), Hubble, Spitzer, the Swift x-ray 
telescope, and XMM-Newton. The Impactor itself took images as little as 3 seconds before impact, which were transmitted via the flyby vehicle 
back to Earth. Controllers registered about 4,500 images from the three cameras over the next few days. Based on the results of Deep Impact™s inves
-tigations, scientists concluded that Comet Tempel 
1 had probably originated in the Oort Cloud. The data also showed that the comet was about 75% empty space. Although Deep Impact™s primary 
mission was over, because the vehicle still had 
plenty of propellant left, on 3 July 2007, NASA approved a new supplemental mission for Deep Impact, known as EPOXI, derived from the com-bination of the two components of this extended flight: Extrasolar Planet Observations (EPOCh) and Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI). This so-called ﬁMission of Opportunityﬂ was orig-inally focused on Comet 85P/Boethin; on 21 July 2005, Deep Impact was set on a trajectory to con-duct a flyby of Earth in anticipation of the intercept of Boethin. Unfortunately, scientists lost track of 
Comet Boethin (possibly because the comet had broken up) and Deep Impact was instead directed towards Comet 103P/Hartley (or Hartley 2) begin-ning with a burn on 1 November 2007. EPOXI™s 
new plan set Deep Impact on three consecutive Earth flybys, spread over two years (in December 2007, December 2008, and June 2010) before the final trek to meet Comet Hartley 2. These flybys essentially ﬁstole some energyﬂ from the space-craft, thus dropping Deep Impact into a smaller orbit around the Sun. Before the second Earth flyby, Deep Impact performed its EPOCh mission 
using the HRI instrument to perform photometric investigations of extrasolar planets around eight distant stars, returning nearly 200,000 images. In the fall of 2010, Deep Impact began its investiga-tions of Comet Hartley 2, conducting its flyby of the target at a range of 694 kilometers at 15:00 UT on 4˜November 2010. As with the encounter with 
Comet Tempel 1, Deep Impact used its three instru
-ments to study Hartley 2 for three weeks. Some of the images were so clear that scientists were able 
to identify jets of dust with particular features on 
the comet™s nucleus. The data showed that the two 
lobes of Hartley 2 were different in composition. Once past this second cometary encounter, Deep 
Impact had little propellant for further cometary investigations, but there was a possibility that the spacecraft, if still in working condition, could be used for a flyby of Near Earth Asteroid 2002 GT in 
2020. With that goal in mind, thrusters were fired 
in December 2011 and October 2012 for target
-ing purposes. In the meantime, the spacecraft was used for remote study of faraway comets such as C/200P1 (Garradd) in early 2012 and C/2012 S1 (ISON) in early 2013. Communications with Deep Impact were lost sometime between 11 August and 
14 August 2013, and after ﬁconsiderable effortﬂ 
to contact the spacecraft, NASA announced on 20˜September that it had officially abandoned 
efforts to contact Deep Impact.208Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

Atmospheric structure investigationResults: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a large orbiter, modeled in part on NASA™s highly 
successful Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, designed to photograph Mars from orbit for about two Earth years. Its primary goals were to map the 
Martian surface with a high-resolution camera (the 
HiRISE 0.5-meter diameter reflecting telescope, 
the largest ever carried on a deep space mission), at least partly to help select sites for future landing 

missions. Supplementary investigations included 

studies of the Martian climate, weather, atmo
-sphere, and geology. Along with the basic six instru
-
ments, MRO also carried an optical navigation 

camera and Electra, a UHF telecommunications package to provide navigation and communications 
support to other landers and rovers on the surface 
of Mars. After launch, MRO entered orbit around 

Earth. Soon after, the Centaur upper stage fired for 
a second time to dispatch its payload (and itself) to escape velocity on a trajectory to intercept with 
Mars. After a seven-month trip through interplane
-tary space and three mid-course corrections, MRO 
approached Mars and, on 10 March 2006, fired its six engines (which displayed slightly reduced thrust), and successfully entered into a highly ellip-tical orbit around the Red Planet with parameters 

of 426 × 44,500 kilometers with a period of 35.5 hours. A subsequent combination of aerobraking in 
the upper atmosphere and engine burns between 7 April and 11 September 2006 left MRO in its final operational orbit of approximately 250 × 316 
kilometers. Two months later, it began its primary 

science mission, joining five other active spacecraft in orbit or on the surface of Mars: Mars Global 240BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Surveyor, 2001 Mars Odyssey, the two Mars 
Exploration Rovers, and the European Mars 
Express. By December 2006, the operation of one of MRO™s instruments, the Mars climate sounder, 
was suspended due to anomalies in its field of view. 
All other instruments, however, returned vast 
amounts of uninterrupted and valuable data during the first two years of MRO™s operations, known as 
the Primary Science Phase, which extended from 
November 2006 to November 2008. One of the early findings from imagery collected by HiRISE 
was the presence of liquid carbon dioxide or water on the surface of Mars in its recent past. During the Extended Science Phase, from November 2008 to December 2010, MRO faced a number of tech-nical obstacles, primarily related to seemingly 
spontaneous rebooting of its computer four times in 2009. At one point, the spacecraft was essen
-tially shut down beginning 26 August. Finally, on 
8 December, engineers commanded the orbiter out 
of ﬁsafe modeﬂ and slowly began initiating science operations using its scientific instruments. As it 
was back on the job, MRO passed an important symbolic milestone on 3 March 2010 when it had 
reached 100 terabits of data transmitted back to Earth, which NASA said was ﬁmore than three times the amount of data from all other deep-space missions combined.ﬂ MRO continued to return high quality data, despite another reboot event in 
September 2010. Many of its activities were coor-dinated with other Mars spacecraft. For example, 
in December 2010, researchers used data from the CRISM instrument to help the Opportunity rover study the distribution of minerals in Endeavour 
Crater on the ground. A new phase of MRO™s mis
-sion began in December 2010, the Extended Mission, whose goal was to explore seasonal pro-cesses on Mars, search for surface changes, and also provide support for other Martian spacecraft including the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). It was during this period, in March 2011, that MRO passed its five-year anniversary orbiting Mars. Later in August, NASA announced that MRO data 
indicated that water might actually be flowing on Mars during the warmest months of the year; MRO images had shown dark finger-like features, known 
as Recurring Slope Linea (RSLs) that appear and disappear on some slopes during late spring through summer but disappear during winter. On 14 March 
2012, MRO captured a 20-kilometer-high dust 
devil whirling its way across the Amazonis Planitia 
region of northern Mars. Later, in October 2012, 
NASA initiated MRO™s second Extended Mission, 
which expired in October 2014. Late in 2013, MRO turned its gaze outwards, to Comet ISON, a comet racing in from the Oort Cloud, which passed by Mars on 29 September. During this second 
Extended Mission, MRO passed the point of trans-mitting 200 terrabits of science data back to Earth. Once again, there was a computer anomaly on board the spacecraft: on 9 March 2014, MRO put 
itself in safe mode after an unscheduled swap from one main computer to another. Four days later, the 
vehicle resumed normal science operations (along with its activities relaying data back to Earth from 
the Curiosity rover). Because of the impending flyby of Mars by Comet C/2013A1 (or Comet Siding Spring) on 19 October 2014, NASA began to shift the orbit of MRO (as well as its other oper
-ational orbiter, 2001 Mars Odyssey) to minimize 
risk of damage from material shed by the comet. 
Orbit adjustments were made by MRO on 2 July and then again on 27 August. In the event, MRO 
captured the best ever views of a comet from the Oort Cloud when Siding Spring flew by Mars on 19 October. The spacecraft also suffered no dam
-age as a result of the flyby. For the seventh time in 
its time in orbit, MRO put itself in a precautionary standby mode on 11 April 2015 when there was an 
unplanned switch from one main computer to another. Within a week the spacecraft once again 
returned to full operational capability. Later, in 
January 2016, controllers completed a planned flash-memory rewrite in one of the spacecraft™s 
redundant computers in order to load new data in 
the form of tables on the positions of Earth and the Sun. Earlier, in August 2015, MRO celebrated a 
decade since its launch, by which time it had 2412005
 orbited Mars 40,000 times and returned 250 tera-bits of data; NASA announced that every week, the spacecraft was still returning more information on Mars than the weekly total of all other active Mars missions. Soon after, in September 2015, scientists 
published evidence in the journal Nature Geoscience that data from MRO™s imaging spectrometer pro
-vided the strongest evidence yet that liquid water 
still flows intermittently on present-day Mars. Scientists later concluded that water ice makes up half or more of an underground layer in the Utopia 
Planitia region. In July 2016, research results were published indicating that gullies on modern day MarsŠchannels with an alcove at the top and deposited material at the bottomŠwere probably not formed by flowing liquid water, and instead 
perhaps by the freeze and thaw of carbon dioxide frost. The data from MRO also provided the basis 
for a large crowd-sourced experiment in 2016. Using the Planet Four: Terrains Web site, ten thou
-sand volunteers used images (taken by the Context Camera) of the Martian south polar regions to identify targets for closer inspection (by the 
HiRISE camera), thus generating new insights on 
seasonal slabs of carbon dioxide and erosional fea-tures on Mars known as ﬁspiders.ﬂ On 28 September 2016, MRO was to have provided critical commu-nications support for the arrival of the InSight Mars lander mission (enabled in part by an orbital maneuver carried out more than a year before, on 29 July 2015). However, the InSight launch was 
postponed to 2018 due to development problems in one of its instruments as well as the relative infrequency of the short launch window chosen for the mission. At several points during its mission, 
MRO photographed artificial objects on the Martian surface. In January 2015, NASA 
announced that high resolution images taken by 
MRO had identified Beagle 2™s wreckage on the 
Martian surface. Similarly, images taken in 
December 2014 and April 2015 by the HiRISE 
instrument also showed NASA™s Curiosity rover 
inside Gale Crater. Later, in October 2016, images 
taken by both the Context Camera and the HiRISE camera showed ESA™s Schiaparelli test lander that 
stopped transmitting before final impact. In early 2017, nearly 11 years after arriving at Mars, MRO remains operational and the second longest-lived spacecraft to orbit Mars, after 2001 Mars Odyssey.

Launch Date and Time:
 9 November 2005 / 03:33:34 UT
Launch Site: GIK-5 / Site 31/6
Scientific Instruments:1. analyzer of space plasma and energetic atoms (ASPERA)2. Venus Express magnetometer (MAG)

4. ultraviolet and infrared atmospheric spec-trometer (SPICAV/SOIR)
5. Venus radio science experiment (VeRa)
6. visible and infrared thermal imaging spec-trometer (VIRTIS)7. Venus monitoring camera (VMC)
Results: Venus Express was a spacecraft, similar in 
design to ESA™s Mars Express, designed to conduct 
a global investigation of the Venusian atmosphere, 
its plasma environment, and surface character-istics, from a 24-hour near-polar elliptical orbit 
around Venus. The spacecraft was launched by a 
Soyuz-FG/Fregat combination owned by Starsem, a 
French company which markets the Russian Soyuz 
in its ﬁEuropeanﬂ version. The Soyuz-FG delivered the payload into a low Earth orbit, with the Fregat 
firing a second time 96 minutes after launch to send the entire stack out of Earth orbit towards Venus. 
The spacecraft carried out a single mid-course 242BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
correction on the way to Venus, on 11˜November 
2005, before arriving at Venus on 11 April 2006 
after a five-month journey. The main engine fired 
at 07:10:29 UT (spacecraft time) to insert Venus 
Express into orbit around the planet, thus becom-ing the first European spacecraft to orbit Venus. It 
achieved its operational orbitŠ250 × 66,000 kilo-metersŠby 7 May 2007. The original mission of Venus Express was anticipated to last no more than 
500 Earth days, but the mission was extended five times past its nominal mission (which ended on 19 September 2007); it was extended first to May 2009, then to December 2009, then to December 2012, then to 2014, and finally to 2015. Among 
its initial accomplishments was to generate a com-plete temperature map of the southern hemisphere of the planet by December 2006. Further major 
findings included evidence for past oceans on the 
surface of Venus, a higher prevalence of lightning 
on Venus than Earth, and the discovery of a huge 
ﬁdouble atmospheric vortexﬂ at the south pole of 
the planet. In 2011, scientists studying data from Venus Express reported the existence of a layer of 
ozone in the upper atmosphere of the planet. After 
eight years in orbit, as propellant supplies to main-tain its elliptical orbit began running low, routine 
science experiments were concluded on 15 May 
2014, and mission scientists decided undertake a series of aerobraking campaigns during which the spacecraft would ﬁdipﬂ deeper into the atmosphere than it had before. The lowest point of 129.1 kilo-meters was reached on 11 July. The duration of 
these ﬁdipsﬂ was about 100 seconds long with max-imum dynamic pressure at 0.75 Newton per square meter, probably a record for a spacecraft still oper
-ating in orbit around a planetary body. After about 
a month in late June and early July ﬁsurfing in and outﬂ of the Venusian atmosphere, during which 
time critical data was collected on the effects of atmospheric drag and heating, the spacecraft per-formed a 15-day climb back up, beginning 12 July, 
which ended by reaching an orbit with a lowest point of 460 kilometers. Having reached this orbit, Venus Express decayed naturally the remainder of 
the year. There was an attempt in late November 
to arrest this decay but contact with the spacecraft 
was lost on 28 November 2014, with only inter-mittent telemetry and telecommand links after that point. On 16 December, ESA officially announced 
the end of the mission although a carrier signal was still being received. The last time that this X-band carrier signal was detected was on 19 January 2015, suggesting that the orbiter burned up in the atmosphere soon after.

6. Pluto energetic particle spectrometer sci-ence investigation (PEPSSI)7. student dust counter (SDC)Results: New Horizons is a mission sent to study the dwarf planet Pluto, its moons, and other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system that extends from about 30 AU, near the orbit of 
Neptune, to about 50 AU from the Sun. The first 
mission of NASA™s New Frontiers programŠa 
medium-class, competitively selected, and Principal Investigator-led series of missionsŠthat 
also includes Juno and OSIRIS-REx, New Horizons was the first spacecraft to encounter Pluto, a relic from the formation of the solar system. By the time of its Pluto system encounter, the spacecraft had to 
travel farther away and for a longer time period 
(more than nine years) than any previous deep space spacecraft ever launched. The design of the spacecraft was based on a lineage traced back to the CONTOUR and TIMED spacecraft, both also built by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns 
Hopkins University. Besides its suite of scientific 
instruments, New Horizons carries a cylindrical radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), a 
spare from the Cassini mission, that provided about 250 W of power at launch (decaying to 200 W by the time of the Pluto encounter). After reaching 
initial Earth orbit at 167 × 213 kilometers, the Centaur upper stage fired (for a second time) for 9 minutes to boost the payload out to an elliptical orbit that stretched to the asteroid belt. A second 
firing of the Star 48B solid rocket accelerated the spacecraft to a velocity of 58,536 kilometers/hour, 
the highest launch velocity attained by a human-made object relative to Earth. It was now set on a trajectory to the outer reaches of the solar system. 
Controllers implemented mid-course corrections on 28 and 30 January and 9 March 2006, and a 
month later, on 7 April, New Horizons passed the 
orbit of Mars. A fortuitous chance to test some of 
the spacecraft™s instrumentationŠespecially 
RalphŠoccurred on 13 June 2006 when New Horizons passed by a tiny asteroid named 132524 APL at a range of 101,867 kilometers. The space-craft flew by the solar system™s largest planet, 
Jupiter, for a gravity assist maneuver on 28 February 
2007 with a closest approach at 05:43:40 UT. The 
encounter increased the spacecraft™s velocity by 
14,000 kilometers/hour, shortening its trip to Pluto 
by three years. During the flyby, New Horizons car
-ried out a detailed set of observations over a period of four months in early 2007. These were both 
designed to gather new data on Jupiter™s atmo
-sphere, ring system, and moons (building on 
research from Galileo) and to test out instruments. 244BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Although observing the moons from distances much farther than Galileo, New Horizons was still 
able to return impressive pictures of Io (including 
eruptions on its surface), Europa, and Ganymede. Following the Jupiter encounter, New Horizons 

sped its way towards the Kuiper Belt, performing a 
mid-course correction on 25 September 2007. It was in hibernation mode from 28 June 2007 during which time the spacecraft™s on-board computer 
kept tabs on mission systems, transmitting special 
codes indicating that operations were either nomi-
nal or anomalous. During hibernation, most major 
systems of New Horizons were deactivated, revived only about two months every year. The second, 

third, and forth hibernation cycles were activated 
on 16 December 2008, 27 August 2009, and 
29˜August 2014. It passed the halfway point to 
Pluto on 25 February 2010. The discovery of new 
NASA™s New Horizon spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on 14 July 2015. The image 
combines blue, red, and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Resolution is 

as high in places as 1.3 kilometers.

 moons (Kerberos and Styx) around Pluto during the mission added to suspicions that there might be debris or dust around Pluto. Mission planners devised two possible contingency plans in case 
debris increased as the spacecraft approached Pluto, either using its antenna facing the incoming particles as a shield, or flying closer to Pluto where there might be less debris. On 6 December 2014, ground controllers revived New Horizons from hibernation for the last time to initiate its active encounter with Pluto. At the time, it took 4 hours 
and 25 minutes for a signal to reach Earth from the spacecraft. The spacecraft began its approach phase towards Pluto on 15 January 2015, its trajec
-tory adjusted with a 93-second thruster burn on 
10˜March. Two days later, with about four months 
remaining before its close encounter, New Horizons 
finally became closer to Pluto than Earth is to the 
Sun. Pictures of Pluto began to reveal distinct fea-tures by 29 April, with detail growing literally week 
by week into its approach. A final 23-second engine 
burn on 29 June accelerated New Horizons towards its target by 27 centimeters/second, also fine-tun-ing its trajectory. There was a minor concern on 
4˜July when New Horizons entered ﬁsafe modeﬂ 
due to a timing flaw in the spacecraft command sequence. Fortunately, the spacecraft returned to 
fully nominal science operations by 7˜July. Three 
days later, data from New Horizons was used to 
conclusively answer one of the most basic myster-ies about the dwarf planet: its size. Mission scien-tists concluded that Pluto is 2,370 kilometers in diameter, slightly larger than prior estimates. 
Charon was confirmed to be 1,208 kilometers in diameter. Finally, at 11:49 UT on 14 July 2015, 
New Horizons flew by about 7,800 kilometers above the surface of Pluto. About 13 hours later, at 
00:53 UT on 15 July, a 15-minute series of status 
messages was received at mission operations at 
Johns Hopkins University™s APL (via NASA™s Deep 
Space Network) confirming that the flyby had 
been fully successful. Besides collecting data on 
Pluto and Charon (flyby at 28,800 kilometers range), New Horizons also observed Pluto™s other

satellites, including Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. 
The download of the entire set of data collected 
during the Pluto/Charon encounterŠabout 6.25 
gigabytes of dataŠtook over 15 months, and offi-cially completed at 21:48 UT on 25 October 2016. 
Such a lengthy period was necessary because the 
spacecraft was roughly 4.5 light-hours from Earth 
and it could only transmit 1Œ2 kb/second. Data 
from New Horizons clearly indicated that Pluto and 
its satellites were far more complex than imagined, 
and scientists were particularly surprised by the 
degree of ﬁcurrent activityﬂ on Pluto™s surface. The 
atmospheric haze and lower-than-predicted atmo
-spheric escape rate forced scientists to fundamen
-tally revise earlier models of the system. Pluto, in 
fact, displays evidence of vast changes in atmo
-spheric pressure and possibly past presence of run-ning or standing liquid volatiles on its surface. There 
are hints that Pluto could have an internal water-ice 
ocean today. Photographs clearly showed a vast 
thousand-kilometer-wide heart-shaped nitrogen 
glacier (called Sputnik Planitia) on the surface, 
undoubtedly the largest known glacier in the solar 
system. On Charon, images showed an enormous 
equatorial extension tectonic belt, suggesting a 
long-past water ice ocean. In the fall of 2015, after 
its Pluto encounter, mission planners began to redi
-rect New Horizons for a flyby on 1 January 2019 
with 2014 MU69, a Kuiper belt object that is approx-imately 6.4 billion kilometers from Earth. Four 
course corrections were implemented in the fall 
while a fifth was carried out on 1 February 2017. 
The goal of the encounter is to study the surface 
geology of the object, measure surface temperature, 
map the surface, search for signs of activity, mea
-sure its mass, and detect any satellites or rings. As 
of 3 April, the spacecraft was halfway from Pluto to 
its target. Soon after, on 10 April, New Horizons 
entered hibernation mode, when much of the vehi-cle remained in unpowered mode for ﬁa long sum-mer™s napﬂ that lasted until 11 September. During 
this time, the flight computer broadcast a weekly 
beacon-status tone back to Earth, and another data 
stream once a month on spacecraft health and 
safety data. On the first anniversary of its Pluto/Charon flyby, on 14 July 2017, the New Horizons 
team unveiled new detailed maps of both planetary 
bodies. As of 4 November 2017 New Horizons was 
40.31 AU (6.03 billion kilometers) from Earth and 
traveling at approximately 14.22 kilometers/second 
(relative to the Sun) heading generally in the direc-tion of the constellation Sagittarius. The mission is 
currently extended through 2021 to explore addi-tional Kuiper belt objects.

3. in-situ measurements of particles and CME transients (IMPACT)
4. plasma and suprathermal ion composition (PLASTIC)Results: STEREO (Solar Terrestrial Relations Obser
-vatory), the third mission in NASA™s Solar Terrestrial 
Probes (STP) program, consists of two space-based observatories to study the structure and evolution of solar storms as they emerge from the Sun and move out through space. The two spacecraft, one ahead of Earth in its orbit and the other trailing behind, 2472006
 are providing the first stereoscopic images of the Sun, and collecting data on the nature of its cor-onal mass ejections (CMEs), represented by large bursts of solar wind, solar plasma, and magnetic fields that are ejected out into space. Such CMEs can disrupt communications, power grids, satel-lite operations, and air travel here on Earth. Both spacecraft were inserted into an initial orbit around Earth at 165 × 171 kilometers. Following a second 
and third burn, the two spacecraft were sent into a translunar orbit, planned at 182 × 40,3810 kilome-ters at 28.5° inclination. Just after the final burn, at 01:19 UT, STEREO A separated from STEREO B. 
On the fifth orbit for both, on 15 December 2006, both spacecraft swung by the Moon, and using a 
gravitational assist maneuver, were sent to different 
orbits. STEREO A was in a solar orbit inside Earth™s 
orbit (and ﬁAheadﬂ) while STEREO B remained in a high Earth orbit. STEREO B encountered the Moon again on 21˜January 2007, and was acceler
-ated into the opposite direction from STEREO A; 
it entered heliocentric orbit outside of Earth™s orbit 
(and ﬁbehindﬂ). The orbital periods of STEREO A 
and STEREO B are 347 days and 387 days, respec-tively. The two spacecraft separate from each other 
at a (combined) annual rate of 44°. A star tracker 
failed briefly on STEREO B but this had no impact on the mission. Later, in May 2009, the same 
spacecraft was successfully rebooted with a new guidance and control software. A similar reset was 
implemented with STEREO A in August of the 
same year. A transponder malfunction in July 2013 
briefly interrupted science activities on STEREO B. More seriously, the spacecraft suffered a failure 
of its Inertial Measurement Unit in January 2014 but controllers managed to revive the spacecraft quickly. At various points, the spacecraft were 
separated from each other by 90°˜and 180°. The 
latter occurred on 6 February 2011 allowing the 
entire Sun to be seen at once for the first time by any set of spacecraft. On 23 July 2012, during an ﬁextremeﬂ solar storm more powerful than anything 
seen in the past 150 years, STEREO A was able 
to collect significant data on the phenomenon. Unanticipated high temperatures in the high gain antenna feed horns of both spacecraft were detected in June 2014, effectively reducing the data return rate, thus curtailing the science pro-gram. Because of this problem, mission scientists formulated a reduced program of science opera
-tions for STEREO A in August 2014, one that was 
further thwarted by a massive proton storm (caused by a large solar flare on the far side of the Sun) on 3 
September 2014. The high- energy particle fluxes were so high that star trackers on both STEREO 
spacecraft were reset. Later, on 1˜October, com
-munications were lost with STEREO B immedi
-ately after a planned reset of the spacecraft. All 
attempts to recover contact were in vain and it is thought that anomalies in the guidance and control system of the spacecraft might have rendered the spacecraft powerless as a result of drift away from direct exposure of the Sun to its solar panels. Con-trollers hoped at the time that eventually STEREO B would drift into ﬁproperﬂ orientation (much like SOHO in 1998) and would power up and resume 
its mission. Remarkably, 22 months after loss of 
contact, on 21 August 2016, NASA™s DSN reestab
-lished communications with STEREO B (having tried once a month through this period). Con-trollers concluded that STEREO B was probably spinning out of control around its principal axis of inertia. This uncontrolled orientation allowed some power generation but not enough time to upload a software fix. STEREO A meanwhile was entered 
into a ﬁsafe modeﬂ deliberately in March 2015 for 
several months during a superior solar conjunction, i.e., a period when the spacecraft is on the oppo
-site side of the Sun from Earth. Communication was reestablished with the spacecraft on 11 July 2015 when images were received again, although 
the science program remained at a low status until 
17˜November 2015 when STEREO A began to 
operate at full capacity again. The key element here was the transmission of real-time data, known 
as beacon data from coronagraph imagery. As of 
early 2017, STEREO A continues to operate with
-out problems.2492007

Scientific Instruments:1. electric field instruments (EFI)2. fluxgate magnetometer (FGM)3. search coil magnetometer (SCM)4. electrostatic analyzer (ESA)5. solid state telescope (SST)Results: The two Artemis lunar orbit missions were 
repurposed from the original Time History of 
Events and Macroscale Interactions during Sub-storms (THEMIS) mission that involved five NASA satellites, THEMIS A, B, C, D, and E, which stud
-ied a type of magnetic phenomena (ﬁsubstormsﬂ) in Earth™s magnetosphere that tend to intensify auro
-ras near Earth™s poles. Each of the five satellites car
-ried identical instrumentation. After a burn of the 
third stage, the five THEMIS spacecraftŠinitially joined but soon separatedŠwere deposited into a 469 × 87,337 km × 16.0° orbit around Earth. In its ﬁstring-of-pearlsﬂ configuration, the five THEMIS satellites carried out its initial mission without any 
significant anomalies. On 19 May 2008, Space Sciences Laboratories, developer of the spacecraft 
at University of CaliforniaŒBerkeley, announced 
that NASA had extended the THEMIS mission to 
2012 and that two of the THEMIS satellites, B and C, would venture into lunar orbit as part of a new mission under the name ARTEMIS (Acceleration, 
Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics 
of the Moon™s Interaction with the Sun). In this 
new mission, THEMIS B and C were renamed ARTEMIS P1 and ARTEMIS P2, respectively, 
and redirected to study the EarthŒMoon Lagrange points, the solar wind, the Moon™s plasma wake, 
and the interaction between Earth™s magnetotail 
and the Moon™s own weak magnetism. (The ﬁP1ﬂ 
and ﬁP2ﬂ designations were leftover terminology from the THEMIS mission which used ﬁP1ﬂ and ﬁP2ﬂ to denote the operational orbits of THEMIS B and C). On the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 
XI landing, on 20 July 2009, ARTEMIS P1 and P2 
officially began low thrust maneuvers that, over the 
course of the following year-and-a-half, led them 
to the L2 and L1 Lagrange points, opposite the near and far sides of the Moon, respectively. (This 
phase included a lunar flyby on 28 March 2010 by ARTEMIS P2.) On 25 August 2010, an engine 
burn propelled ARTEMIS P1 into orbit around the 
EarthŒMoon L2 Lagrange point, located on the far side of the Moon, about 61,300 kilometers above the lunar surface. This was the first time that a spacecraft had successfully entered orbit around an EarthŒMoon libration point. The second space-craft, ARTEMIS P2 arrived at L1 on 22 October 
2010 by which time P1 had completed about four revolutions around L2. Although the station-
 keeping at the Lagrange points on the way to the Moon was motivated to avoid Earth™s long shadows 
in its original orbits (thus keeping the spacecraft operational), here at the two Lagrange points, the 
250BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
two spacecraft collected magnetospheric data from 
opposite sides of the Moon, critical for simulta-neous measurements of particles and electric and magnetic fields to build a three-dimensional map of the acceleration of energetic particles near the Moon™s orbit. On 27 June 2011, ARTEMIS P1 suc
-cessfully entered lunar orbit with an initial orbit of roughly 3,543 × 27,000 kilometers while its sister vehicle, ARTEMIS P2 arrived on 17 July 2011, 
after a two-year journey from Earth orbit. Over the next three months, mission controllers imple-mented a series of maneuvers to move the second spacecraft into an orbit with a period of 27.5 hours, similar to its companion, but moving in the oppo-site direction. The two spacecraft, orbiting in oppo-site directions around the Moon, began to provide the first 3D measurements of the Moon™s magnetic 
field to determine its regional influence on solar wind particles. More specifically, the two space
-craft revealed new information on the lunar ﬁwakeﬂ that extends about 12 lunar radii and in particularly how its void distorts the interplanetary magnetic field causing it to bulge moonward. As of January 
2016, the two spacecraft remained in good health and operating in their stable but highly elliptical 
lunar orbits. Mission scientists marked the tenth anniversary of the launch in February 2017, with 
the spacecraft still in good health.213

Scout Program to send a series of small, low-cost, low complexity, and higher frequency robotic mis
-sions to Mars. (The second and last mission in the series was MAVEN launched in 2013; Mars 
missions were then folded into the Discovery Program where they would compete with missions to other planetary destinations). Its science goals included studying the history of water on Mars in all its phases, searching for evidence of habitable zones, and assessing the biological potential of the iceŒsoil boundary. More broadly, the lander was 
designed to determine whether life ever existed on Mars, characterize the climate and geology of the Red Planet, and help prepare for future 
human exploration of its surface. The spacecraft was essentially built on the basis of the abandoned and never-launched Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander 
and contained other instruments built in support 
of the unsuccessful Mars Polar Lander mission. It 
was the first NASA mission to Mars that was led directly from a public university, the University of 
Arizona, more specifically its Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. The primary mission was designed to 
last 90 sols (Mars days) or approximately 92 Earth days. After two burns of the Delta™s second stage, 
the PAM-D upper stage (with a Star 48 motor) fired 
at 10:44 UT on 4 August 2007 to send the Phoenix 
lander towards Mars. It conducted mid-course cor

As it approached Mars, the orbits of three other spacecraft orbiting MarsŠMars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), 2001 Mars Odyssey, and Mars 
ExpressŠwere adjusted so that they could observe Phoenix™s entry into the atmosphere. In addition, 
MRO™s HiRISE instrument was used to thoroughly 
scout out the landing area, with some images iden-tifying rocks smaller than the lander itself. Phoenix entered the Martian atmosphere at nearly 21,000 
kilometers/hour on 25 May 2008 and touched down safely on the surface at 23:38:38 UT in the Green Valley of Vastitas Borealis. It was the first 
successful landing of a stationary soft-lander on Mars since Viking 2, 32 years before. During its 
descent, MRO™s HiRISE camera clearly photo
-graphed Phoenix suspended from its parachute, the first time one spacecraft photographed another during a planetary landing. The lander waited 15 minutes for the dust to settle before unfurling its solar panels. The first images showed a flat sur
-face marred by pebbles and troughs, but no large 
rocks or hills as expected given its northern posi-tion. Within four days, Phoenix had transmitted a 
complete 360° panorama of the cold Martian sur-face, deployed the nearly 2.5-meter robotic arm, and started returning regular weather reports. On 31 May, the robotic arm scooped up dirt and began 
sampling Martian soil for ice. Already by 19 June 
2008, mission scientists were able to conclude that clumps of bright material in the so-called ﬁDodo-Goldilocksﬂ trench dug by the robotic arm were probably water ice: the material had vaporized in four days after the scoop. On 31 July 2008, NASA officially announced that, based on an analysis (by TEGA™s mass spectrometer) of a sample collected 
by the lander, that there is water on Mars. William 
Boynton of the University of Arizona noted that 
such data adds to the claims from the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter whose data also indicated like-wise. On 5 August, in response to media rumors 
about the possibility of life on Mars, the Phoenix team announced that they had found perchlorates on the surface of Mars that neither confirmed nor refuted the possibility of life on Mars. The results also led scientists to revisit the data from the Viking 
Landers. By the end of August, Phoenix had com
-pleted its originally planned 90-day mission, which was extended to 30˜September. On 12 September, 
the lander scoop delivered a new soil sample to its Wet Chemistry Laboratory that mixed an aqueous 
solution from Earth to the soil as part of a process to identify soluble nutrients and other chemicals in the soil. Early results suggested that the soil was 
alkaline, composed of salts and other chemicals 
such as perchlorate, sodium, magnesium, chloride, 
and potassium. On 13 October, Phoenix weath
-ered a dust storm and recovered another soil sam-ple, the sixth, into the TEGA instrument. But as 
the Martian winter was upon the landing site, the 
lander went into safe mode on 28˜October 2008 
due to insufficient sunlight and poor weather condi-tions. During safe mode, non-critical activities were 
suspended while the spacecraft awaited further 
instructions from mission control. There was daily 
communication with the lander from 30˜October to 
2 November but no signals were received after that. 
On 10˜November, NASA announced the lander had 
ﬁfinishe[d its] successful work on [the] Red Planet,ﬂ 
and on 1˜December, the Agency announced that 
NASA ﬁhad stopped using its Mars orbiters to 
hail the lander.ﬂ The loss of the spacecraft was a 
combination of low power and the dust storm. 
During the cold harsh winter, CO
2 iceŠsome of it 
as thick as 19 centimetersŠprobably built up on 
the lander, sufficiently heavy to break the fragile 
solar arrays. Because of this kind of damage, sub-sequent communications attempts with the lander, 
in early 2010, were unsuccessful. On 24 May 2010, 
NASA announced that the project was formally 
ended. Images from MRO conclusively showed 
that Phoenix™s solar panels were severely damaged 
by the freezing during the Martian winter.

 14. differential VLBI radio source experiment (VRAD) 15. high-definition television (HDTV)Results: SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer), named Kaguya (ﬁMoon princessﬂ) after 
launch as a result of a public poll, was the second Japanese lunar probe, whose goal was to orbit the Moon and collect data on the origins and geological evolution of Earth™s only natural satellite, study the 
lunar surface environment, and carry out radio sci-ence experiments. The Japanese noted it was ﬁthe largest lunar mission since the Apollo program.ﬂ 
Besides the main lunar satellite, SELENE, the 
mission also included two small spin-stabilized sub-satellites, each weighing 53 kilograms. These were the Relay Satellite (Rstar) and the VRAD satellite (Vstar). Upon launch, they were renamed Okina and Ouna, which mean ﬁhonorable elderly manﬂ and ﬁhonorable elderly woman,ﬂ respectively. 
Originally slated for launch in 2003 but delayed to 2007 due to problems with the H-II launch vehi-cle, the probe was launched into a highly ellipti-cal parking orbit of 282 × 232,960 kilometers. On 3˜October 2007, Kaguya entered into an initial 
polar orbit around the Moon at 101 × 11,741 kilo-meters, the first time that a Japanese spacecraft had done so. The two subsatellites, Okina and Ouna, were released on 9 October at 00:36 UT and 12˜October at 04:28 UT into corresponding orbits: 115 × 2,399 kilometers and 127 × 795 kilometers. The orbiter itself attained its operational circular 
orbit at 100 kilometers by 19 October. Soon, on 
31 October, Kaguya™s two main HDTV camerasŠ
each a 2.2 megapixel CCD HDTV cameraŠtook the first high definition images of the Moon. A 
week later, on 7 November, the satellite took spec
-tacular footage of an ﬁEarthrise,ﬂ the first since the Apollo missions in the 1970s. The fully operational 
phase of the mission began on 21 December fol-lowing a successful checkout of all the onboard instruments. By 9 April 2008, JAXA was able to 
announce that Kaguya, using its Laser Altimeter, 
had been able to collect enough data to construct 
the topography of the entire lunar surface, with data points 10 orders larger than the previous model of the lunar surface, produced by the Unified Lunar Control Network in 2005, based largely on the American Clementine spacecraft. Its subsequent achievements include detecting gravity anomalies on both the near and far side of the Moon (based on Doppler data from both Kaguya and the Okina spacecraft) and the first optical observation of the 
permanently shadowed interior of the Shackleton Crater. Kaguya completed its original planned mis
-sion by late October 2008, with hopes to continue 
to March 2009 followed by impact in August 2009. 
2532007
 However, because of a faulty reaction wheel, the 
extended mission was ended early. On 1 February 

2009, Kaguya™s orbit was lowered to approximately 
50 kilometers. The orbiter then impacted the Moon 
at 18:25 UT on 10 June 2009 at 65.5° S / 80.4° E 

near Gill Crater. Okina had already impacted the 

Moon at 10:46 UT on 12 February 2009.

orbit from a distance of approximately 385 kilometers. 
 Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA
Results: Dawn, the ninth mission in NASA™s 
Discovery Program, was launched on a nearly-de-cade long mission to study two very different objects which both accreted early in the history of the solar system, the asteroid Vesta (arrival in 2011) 

and the dwarf planet Ceres (arrival in 2015). The 

investigation of these objectsŠthe two largest in the asteroid beltŠwas driven by the three principal scientific motivations: to investigate the conditions 
at the origin of the solar system; to find the nature 
of the building blocks from which the inner planets were formed; and to contrast the very different evo-lutionary paths of Ceres and Vesta. Besides its 
complement of scientific equipment, Dawn also 
carried three xenon ion thrusters (derived from the technology used on the Deep Space 1 spacecraft), each with a thrust of 91 mN and a specific impulse of 3,100 seconds. Some of the scientific equip
-
ment was provided by German and Italian institu-tions. After launch, Dawn was accelerated to 
escape velocity of 11.50 kilometers/second by the 
PAM-D solid propellant third stage which fired at 

12:29 UT. The spacecraft passed lunar orbit at 

around 14:30 UT on 28 September and entered 

solar orbit at roughly 1.00 × 1.62 AU. Long-term 
cruise with the ion thrusters began on 17 December 
2007, and completed on 31 October 2008, nearly 

11 months later. Subsequently, a single trajectory 

correction on 20 November 2008 orchestrated a 
gravity assist flyby past Mars at a range of 542 kilo-meters on 17 February 2009. Over two years later, 
Dawn began to approach its first target, Vesta, 

returning progressively higher resolution images of 
the protoplanet. At around 05:00 UT on 16 July 
2011, Dawn gently slipped into orbit around Vesta 

at an altitude of about 16,000 kilometers, thus 

becoming the first spacecraft to orbit any object in 
the main asteroid belt. Using its xenon-ion engine, 
254BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
it moved into a closer ﬁsurveyﬂ orbit at an altitude of 
about 2,700 kilometers by 2 August, staying at that 
orbit until the end of the month. Later, on 
27˜September, it moved into a closer orbit at an 
altitude of 680 kilometers (with an orbital period of 12.3 hours) staying there until 2 November, during 
which period it fully mapped Vesta six times, 
including in color and in stereo. By 8 December, 
the spacecraft was in a 4.3-hour orbit at an average altitude of just 210 kilometers. Original plans were This mosaic image shows the mysterious mountain Ahuna Mons on Ceres. The images were taken by NASA™s Dawn 
spacecraft from a low-altitude mapping orbit, about 385 kilometers above the surface, in December 2015.

2552007
 to carry out a 70-day mission at that low orbit but 
this was extended to 1 May, during which the 
spacecraft took 13,000 photos covering most of 
Vesta as well as more than 2.6 million visible and 
IR spectra. From 23 June to 25˜July, Dawn was 
back up to 680 kilometers conducting more map-ping, including of areas that had not been visible before. Data from the extended period of study in 2012 allowed scientists to estimate the size of its dense iron-nickel core (about 220 kilometers across), and conclusively identify Vesta as one of 
the few remaining remnants of large planetoids that formed the rocky planets of the solar system. In December 2012, investigators announced that Dawn had detected sinuous gullies on the surface 
of Vesta that might have been caused by liquid 
waterŠsimilar gullies on Earth are carved by liquid water. The data collected by Dawn suggested that 
Vesta is more closely related to terrestrial planets 
such as Earth (and its Moon) than to typical aster-oids. Dawn™s findings also showed that Vesta is the 
source of more meteorites on Earth than Mars or 
the Moon. Pictures also identified immense basins 
on the surface of Vesta such as the 400-kilometer 
diameter Veneneia and the 500-kilometer diame
-ter Rheasilvia basins, created by impacts two and 
one billion years ago, respectively. At 07:26 UT on 
5 September 2012, Dawn escaped the gravita-tional grip of Vesta and headed towards its second 
destination, the dwarf plant Ceres. During its stay 
at Vesta, the two bodies travelled around the Sun 
for 685 million kilometers. On the way to Ceres, Dawn stopped normal ion thrusting and spuriously entered ﬁsafe modeﬂ on 11˜September 2014. 
Fortunately, ground controllers were able to deter
-mine the source of the problemŠa coincidental combination of high-energy particles that disabled the ion propulsion system and a previously unknown bug in the spacecraft softwareŠand 
resumed normal ion firing by 15˜September. 
Approach operations to Ceres began in January 2015 although during the approach phase, Dawn took fewer photographs of its target (than with Vesta) due to problems with two of its four reaction 
wheels, the first of which failed on 17˜June 2010. 
Needing at least three wheels to be operational, the 
mission team devised a plan to allow the spacecraft to operate using only two (in case another failed) in combination with hydrazine reaction control 
thrusters. A second wheel indeed failed, on 
8˜August 2012, just as Dawn was spiraling away 
from Vesta and beginning its trip to Ceres. The 
mission team implemented plans to conserve the 
much needed hydrazine (now more valuable than ever). All of these strategies allowed Dawn to 
approach Ceres slightly compromised but largely operational. At 00:39 UT on 7 March 2015, Dawn 
finally entered initial (polar) orbit around Ceres, thus becoming the first mission to study a dwarf plant, ahead of the New Horizons encounter with Pluto four months later. Dawn also became the 
first spacecraft to orbit two different celestial bod-ies (other than the Sun, of course). In planning for 
the mission, scientists had envisioned four differ-ent circular mapping orbitsŠcalled RC3, Survey, 
HAMO, and LAMOŠaround Ceres, from one as high as 13,600 kilometers (RC3) to as low as 385 kilometers (LAMO). Dawn remained in its first mapping orbit, RC3, from 23 April to 9 May 2015 
carrying out photography, taking spectra at infrared 
and visible wavelengths, and searching for lofted 
dust as evidence of water vapor. On 9 May the 
spacecraft began using its ion engine to spiral down to reach its second mapping orbit by 3 June at about 4,400 kilometers, with its science mission beginning two days later. The orbital period at this 
point was 3.1 days. During this phase, lasting eight 
orbits, Dawn carried out extensive scientific obser-vations over the sunlit side of Ceres. This phase, completed by 30 June, was punctuated by a minor alarm on 27 June due to anomalies in two of the 
scientific instruments, and a problem on 30 June when the spacecraft went into safe mode due to a problem with its orientation (later traced to a mechanical gimbal system that swivels one of its three ion engines). On 13 August 2015, it arrived 
in its third mapping orbit and stopped using its ion thrusters. Orbital altitude was 1,470 kilometers 256BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
with a period of 19 hours. Its science mission in 
this orbit began four days later. Over the next six 
months, the spacecraft mapped Ceres six times. 
Mission Director at JPL Marc Rayman noted that 
this would be ﬁsome of the most intensive observa
-tions of its entire mission.ﬂ At 23:30 UT on 
23˜October, Dawn turned one of its ion engines 
(no. 2) to move to its next orbit, a passage that 
took about seven weeks. On 7 December, the 
engine was turned off as the spacecraft reached its 
final mapping orbit at about 385 kilometers alti-tude. After some further orbital tweaking on 11
 Œ13˜December, Dawn™s orbit was synchronized with 
Ceres™ rotation around its axis. Finally, on 
18˜December, the spacecraft began its next sci
-ence phase in its new orbit, which it maintained 
for nearly nine months until 2 September 2016. 
During this period, the spacecraft obtained exten-sive data with its combined gamma-ray and neu
-tron spectrometer as well as its infrared mapping 
spectrometer. Circling the dwarf planet every 5.4 
hours, the standard high-resolution mapping pro
-grams were also in effect. By 3 May, Dawn™s time 
in orbit around Ceres exceeded its time in orbit 
around Vesta in 2011Œ2012. A couple of months 
later, on 30 June 2016, JPL announced that Dawn 
had concluded its fully completed prime mission. 
By this point, it had taken 69,000 images and 
completed 2,450 orbits around both Vesta and 
Ceres. In addition, the ion engines had fired for 
48,500 hours. NASA approved an extended mis-sion at the time, opting not to have Dawn travel to 
a large asteroid known as Adeona but to continue 
to explore Ceres. On 2 September 2016, Dawn 
began a new five-week journey to a higher orbit 
after a highly successful stay at lower altitudes. 
The spacecraft reached a new orbit at 1,480 kilo-meters with an orbital period of 18.9 hours by 6 
October, having begun an extended science mis
-sion 10 days later. On 4 November, it began climb
-ing higher again and reached its sixth science orbit 
(known as ﬁextended mission orbit 3ﬂ or XMO3) 
on 5 December at about 7,520 × 9,350 kilometers 
altitude. Here it measured the cosmic ray noise to 
calibrate the data on Ceres™ nuclear radiation that 
was collected when it was at 385 kilometers. 
Dawn was basically in good condition in early 
2017 despite a temporary switch to ﬁsafe modeﬂ 
on 17 January. On 23 April 2017, mission control
-lers discovered that two of the remaining reaction 
wheels on board the spacecraft had stopped work-ing, thus jeopardizing attitude control. By using 
hydrazine, controllers were able to return Dawn to 
standard flight configuration. A few days later, on 
29 April, Dawn successfully observed Ceres at 
opposition, i.e., from a position between Ceres 
and the Sun, allowing the spacecraft to view the 
bright Occator Crater from a new perspective. 
Soon after celebrating the tenth anniversary of its 
launch, NASA announced on 19˜October 2017 
that it had authorized a second extension to the 
mission. During the extension, Dawn will descend 
to lower than beforeŠpossibly 200 kilometersŠto continue studies of the dwarf planet, focused 
on measuring the number and energy of gamma 
rays and neutrons. One of the most important dis-coveries made by Dawn was the existence of wide-spread ice just below the surface of Ceres, 
announced in December 2016. Dawn carries a 
memory chip with the names of more than 
360,000 people who submitted their names as 
part of an outreach effort in 2005 and 2006.216

Sagnac-based interferometer spectrometer imager3. laser altimeter4. microwave radiometer5. gamma and x-ray spectrometer6. space environment monitor system (a high-energy particle detector and 2 solar wind detectors)Results: Chang™e 1 was the first deep space mission 
launched by China, part of the first phase of the 
so-called Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, 
divided into three phases of ﬁcircling around the 
Moon,ﬂ ﬁlanding on the Moon,ﬂ and ﬁreturning 
from the Moonﬂ that would be accomplished 
between 2007 and 2020. The goal of this first 
mission, besides proving basic technologies and 
testing out several engineering systems, was to 
create a three-dimensional map of the lunar sur-face, analyze the distribution of certain chemi-cals on the lunar surface, survey the thickness of 
the lunar soil, estimate Helium-3 resources, and 
explore the space environment (solar wind, etc.) 
in near-lunar space. The spacecraft itself was 
based on the design of the reliable DFH-3 satellite 
bus. After launch, the spacecraft entered a 205 × 
50,900-kilometer orbit for a day before firing its 50 
kgf thrust main engine at 09:55 UT on 25 October 
to raise perigee to 593 kilometers. Subsequent 
burns (this time near perigee) were performed on 
26 October (at 09:33 UT), 29 October (at 09:49 
UT), and 31 October (at 09:15 UT) increasing 
apogee to 71,600, 119,800, and finally 400,000 
kilometers, respectively. On its way to the Moon, 
Chang™e 1 (or CE-1, as it was often named in the 
Chinese English-language press) made one mid-course correction before entering lunar orbit with 
a 22-minute burn that began at 02:15 UT on 
5˜November 2007, thus becoming the first Chinese 
spacecraft to orbit the Moon. Initial orbital param-eters were 210 × 860 kilometers. Two maneuvers 
on 6 and 7 November lowered perigee to 1,716 
and 200 kilometers, respectively. Its final working 
orbitŠa 200-kilometer polar orbit with a period of 
127 minutesŠwas reached soon after on the same 
day. On 20 November, CE-1 returned the first raw 
image of the lunar surface, and by 28 November, 
all its scientific instruments were fully operational. 
A composite of 19 strips of raw images was issued 
by the Chinese media on 26 November at a cer-emony attended by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. 
There was some controversy regarding this image 
which some believed was a fake or a copy of an 
image returned by Clementine but this proved not 
to be so: the high-quality image was indeed quite 
real. Through December 2007, CE-1 continued to 
photograph the Moon (including in stereo), and 
began imaging the polar regions in January 2008. 
The spacecraft successfully fulfilled its 1-year mis
-sion after which it continued extended operations. 
On 12 November 2008, Chinese space authorities 
issued a full-Moon image map produced using 
CE-1 images taken over 589 orbits covering 100% 
of the lunar surface with a resolution of 120 meters. 
In December 2008, over a period of two weeks, 
the spacecraft™s perigee was progressively low
-ered to 15 kilometers to test operations for future 
orbiter and lander spacecraft. Finally, on 1˜March 
2009, CE-1 was commanded to impact on to the 
lunar surface, making contact at 08:13:10 UT at 
52.27°˜E and 1.66° S, thus becoming the first 
Chinese object to make contact with the Moon. 
Its most significant achievement was to produce 
the most accurate and highest resolution 3D map 
of the lunar surface.2592008

(mass spectrometer) (CHASE)Results: Chandrayaan-1, the first Indian deep space 
mission, was launched to orbit the Moon and dis-patch an impactor to the surface. Scientific goals 
included the study of the chemical, mineralog-ical, and ﬁphoto-geologicﬂ mapping of the Moon. 
Besides five Indian instruments, the spacecraft 
carried scientific equipment from the United 
States, the U.K., Germany, Sweden, and Bulgaria. 
Chandrayaan-1 was launched into an initial geo
-stationary transfer orbit of 225 × 22,817 kilome
-ters at 17.9° inclination. Over a period of 13 days, 
the apogee of the orbit was increased by five burns 
of its 44.9 kgf Liquid Engine that successively 
raised orbit on 23 October (to 37,900 kilometers), 
25 October (to 74,715 kilometers), 26 October 
(to 164,600 kilometers), 29 October (to 267,000 
kilometers), and 4 November (to 380,000 kilome
-ters). Finally, the probe successfully entered lunar 
orbit after a burn that began at 11:21 UT on 8 
November and lasted about 13.5 minutes. Initial 
lunar orbital parameters were 7,502 × 504 kilome-ters. Between lunar orbit insertion on 8 November 
and 12 November, Chandrayaan-1™s orbit was 
reduced gradually so that it ended up finally in 
its operational polar orbit at about 100 kilometers 
above the lunar surface. Two days later, at 14:36 
UT, Chandrayaan released its 29-kilogram Moon 
Impact Probe (MIP) which fired a small deorbit 
motor and went into freefall, sending back read
-ings from its three instruments until it crashed 
onto to the lunar surface at 15:01˜UT near the 
Shackleton crater at the lunar south pole. Indian 
scientists reported that data from the CHASE 
instrument, which took readings every 4 seconds 
during its descent, suggested the existence of 
water in the lunar atmosphere, although the data 
remains inconclusive absent further verification. 
Chandrayaan-1 experienced abnormally high tem-peratures beginning late November 2008, and for a 
time, it could only run one scientific instrument at 
a time. In May 2009, the spacecraft was delivered 
to a higher 200-kilometer orbit, apparently in an 
attempt to keep the temperatures aboard the satel-lite to tolerable levels. Chandrayaan-1 also suffered 
260BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
a star sensor failure after nine months of operation in lunar orbit. A backup sensor also failed soon 
after, rendering inoperable the spacecraft™s primary 
attitude control system. Instead controllers used a 
mechanical gyroscope system to maintain proper attitude. Last contact with the spacecraft was at 20:00 UT on 28 August 2009, thus falling short of 
its planned two-year lifetime, although ISRO noted that at least 95% of its mission objectives had been accomplished by then. The most likely cause of the end of the mission was failure of the power sup-ply due to overheating. Perhaps Chandrayaan-1™s 
most important finding was related to the ques-tion of water on the Moon. In September 2009, scientists published results of data collected by the American M3 instrument which had detected 
absorption features on the polar regions of the sur-face of the Moon usually linked to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing molecules. This finding was fol
-lowed later, in August 2013, by a further announce
-ment of evidence of water molecules locked in mineral grains on the surface of the Moon, i.e., ﬁmagmatic water,ﬂ or water that originates from 
deep in the Moon™s interior. Magmatic water had 
been found in samples returned by Apollo astro
-nauts but not from lunar orbit until the operation of the M3 instrument, although Cassini, during its flyby of the Moon in August 1999, had detected 
(using its VIMS instrument) water molecules and hydroxyl. Later, NASA™s Deep Impact-EPOXI mis
-sion, which flew by the Moon in June 2009 also 
returned the same type of data.2612009

Scientific Instruments:1. photometer (Schmidt telescope)Results: Kepler, the tenth in the series of low-
cost, low-development-time, and highly-focused 
Discovery class science missions, is designed to dis-cover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars in our 
region of the Milky Way. More specifically, Kepler 
has been equipped to look for planets whose size spans from one-half to twice the size of Earth (ﬁter
-restrial planetsﬂ) in the habitable zone of their stars where liquid water might exist in the natural state on the surface of the planet. Its scientific goals include determining the abundance of these plan-ets and the distribution of sizes and shapes of their orbits, estimating the number of planets in multi-ple-star systems, and determining the properties of stars that have planetary systems. Kepler detects planets by observing transits, tiny dips in the bright-ness of a star when a planet crosses in front of it. The spacecraft is basically a single instrumentŠin this case, a specially designed 0.95-meter diame-ter aperture telescope and image sensor arrayŠwith a spacecraft built around it. (The diameter of the telescope™s mirror is 1.4 meters, one of the 
largest mirrors beyond Earth orbit). As originally 
planned, it was designed to monitor about 100,000 main-sequence stars over a period of three-and-a-half years. Kepler was initially launched into Earth orbit at 185 × 185 kilometers at 28.5° inclina-tion. Subsequently, after another first stage burn, 
the second stage fired to set Kepler on an escape trajectory into solar orbit. It passed lunar orbit at 04:20˜UT on 9 March, eventually entering helio
-centric orbit at 0.97 × 1.041 AU at 0.5° inclination 
to the solar ecliptic. In order to improve resolution, 
on 23˜April 2009, mission planners optimized the 
focus of the telescope by moving the primary mirror 40 micrometers toward the focal plane and tilting 
it by 0.0072°. Less than a month later, on 13˜May, 
Kepler finished its commissioning and began its operational mission. Already during its first six 
weeks of operation, Kepler discovered five exo
-planets (which were named Kepler 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b, and 8b), which NASA announced in January 2010. Later, in April 2010, mission scientists published 
results that showed that Kepler had discovered the first confirmed planetary system with more than one planet transiting the same star, Kepler-9. That 
discovery was the result of surveying more than 
156,000 stars over a period of seven months. The planetary system orbiting Kepler-11, a yellow dwarf 
star about 2,000 light years from Earth, included six planets. NASA announced in February 2011 
that these planets were larger than Earth, with 
the largest ones comparable in size to Uranus and 
Neptune. In 2011, Kepler suffered at least two ﬁsafe modeﬂ events, when the spacecraft essen
-tially shut down science operations as a result of a suspected anomaly. In both cases, in February and 
March, the Kepler project team were able to revive 
the vehicle relatively quickly, within two to three 
days. In September, mission scientists announced 
262BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
the discovery of a planet (Kepler-16b) orbiting 
two stars, where we might expect a double sunset, much like the fictional planet Tatooine depicted 
in the film Star Wars
. (A subsequent double-star system was announced in January 2012 and multi-ple planets orbiting multiple starsŠthe Kepler-47 
systemŠwas announced in August 2012). Finally, 
in December 2011, NASA announced that Kepler had found its first planet (Kepler-22b) in the ﬁhab
-itable zoneﬂ of a star where liquid water could exist on the planet™s surface. In April 2012, the mission, 
closing in on its three-and-a-half-year lifetime, was formally extended through fiscal year 2016 after a review of its operations, with the extended mission beginning on 15 November 2012. By that time, Kepler had identified more than 2,300 planet candidates and confirmed more than 100 plan-ets. Based on data collected by Kepler, scientists 
were able to announce in January 2013 that about 17% of stars (about one-sixth) have an Earth-sized planet in an orbit closer than Mercury is to our Sun. Given that the Milky Way has about 100 billion 
stars, this would suggest at least 17 billion Earth-sized worlds in our galaxy. (In November 2013, this 
number was revised up to 40 billion). Following 
two brief lapses into ﬁsafe modeﬂ in May, one of the 
spacecraft™s four reaction wheels (no. 4) was found 
to have failed. Given that an earlier one failed in July 2012 and that at least three such wheels were needed to accurately aim the telescope, there was anxiety that the mission might be jeopardized. Subsequent to that point, and after another safe mode event in late May, Kepler operated in Point 
Rest State (PRS) modeŠwhere the spacecraft 
used thrusters and solar pressure to control point-ingŠwhile controllers devised a way to reactivate the wheels necessary for accurate pointing of the spacecraft. After several months of activity, on 
15˜August 2013, NASA officially announced that 
it would be ending efforts to fully recover Kepler. 
NASA solicited proposals from the public on how to reformulate a new mission for Kepler given its 
obvious limitations. During this period, in October 2013, Kepler mission scientists announced that they had conclusively identified the first Earth-
sized rocky planet, Kepler-78b, which circles its 
host star every eight-and-a-half years, making it a 
very hot planet. A further announcement in April 
2014 confirmed the discovery of the first Earth-sized planet (Kepler-186f) in the ﬁhabitable zoneﬂ 
of a star. At the end of the year, the Kepler team 
proposed a new mission, known as K2 (ﬁSecond Lightﬂ), using the two remaining reaction wheels to investigate smaller and dimmer red dwarf stars. Mission definition of the K2 proposal continued into 2014, with the mission finally approved by NASA in May 2014 and data collection begin-ning on 30 May. Observations continued through 
the year with several ﬁcampaignsﬂ of data collec-tion. As of January 2015, Kepler had found 1,004 
confirmed exoplanets in about 400 star systems. By November 2016, Kepler, now in its K2 mission 
(which included ﬁrelaxed fault or sensitivity limitsﬂ) 
was in its eleventh ﬁcampaignﬂ of scientific obser-vation, which began on 24 September. There was 
some concern on the eve of Campaign 9, slated to begin on 8 April, when controllers found the space
-craft in a ﬁfuel-intensive coma,ﬂ a kind of emer
-gency mode much more serious than a ﬁsafe modeﬂ and closer to complete systems failure. Fortunately, 
controllers were slowly able to fully revive the 
spacecraft by 22 April. On 9 June 2016, NASA 
announced that Kepler would continue science 
operations through to the end of Fiscal Year 2019 
by which time, on-board propellant would proba-bly be depleted. The spacecraft was named after the famed German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571Œ1630).219

Scientific Instruments:1. infrared telescope2. heterodyne instrument for the far infrared (HIFI)3. photoconductor array camera and spec-trometer (PACS)
4. spectral and photometric imaging receiver (SPIRE)Results: Both Herschel and Planck were launched by the same Ariane launch vehicle and were both ESA 
missions (with significant NASA contributions) but they had different science missions. Herschel, the largest infrared telescope ever launched into space (3.5-meter mirror), was designed to study the origin and evolution of stars and galaxies, the chemical composition of atmospheres and surfaces of solar system bodies, and molecular chemistry across the universe, to help understand the evo-lution of the universe. Herschel™s mirror, one-and-
a-half times bigger than the one on Hubble, was made almost entirely of silicon carbide, 12 such segments being brazed together. Following launch, 
Ariane™s ESC-A stage sent both Herschel and 
Planck into a highly elliptical transfer orbit of 270 × 1,197,080 kilometers at 6° inclination to enable the spacecraft to reach the SunŒEarth L2 Lagrange Point, the local gravitationally stable point that is 
fixed in the SunŒEarth System, about 1.5 million kilometers directly ﬁbehindﬂ Earth as viewed from the Sun. Herschel did not have a dedicated engine for major course changes but used its own small thrusters for minor corrections. Herschel™s operat
-ing lifetime was expected to be about three-and-a-half years, determined by the amount of coolant available for its instruments. In mid-July 2009, 
about two months after launch, Herschel entered a Lissajous orbit of 800,000 kilometers (average) radius around L2 and soon, on 21 July, began 
active operations. (Herschel™s distance from Earth 
varied, depending on its orbital position, between 1.2 and 1.8 million kilometers). The observatory™s 
operations were organized in 24-hour cycles where 
it communicated with ground control for 3 hours every day with the remainder of the time dedi-cated to scientific observations. Less than a year later, at a symposium to discuss the first results of 
Herschel, scientists reported a number of major findings: Herschel had found high-mass proto
-stars around two ionized regions in the Milky Way, 
showing an early phase in the evolution of stars; the HIFI instrument (which had actually been inop-erable due to a glitch between August 2009 and 
February 2010) had investigated the trail of water 
in the universe over a wide range of scales, from the solar system to extragalactic sources; and Herschel found a previously unresolved population of galax-ies in the GOODS (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey) fields identified by the Hubble, Spitzer, and Chandra spacecraft. In August 2011, 
Herschel mission scientists reported that they had identified molecular oxygen in the Orion molecular cloud complex, previously reported by the Swedish Odin satellite. Herschel data also suggested that much of Earth™s water could have come from com
-ets, results suggested by observations of Comet 
Hartley 2Šalthough this notion has been dispelled since. Observations by Herschel, in fact, con-firmed that Comet Shoemaker-Levy™s impact into 
Jupiter in 1994 had actually delivered water to the 
gas giant. One of the oldest objects in the universe was located in 2013; scientists published results in 
April that showed the existence of a starburst gal-axy which had produced over 2,000 solar masses of stars a year, originating only 880 million years after 
the Big Bang. On 29 April 2013, Herschel finally 
ran out of the liquid helium coolant required to maintain the operational temperature of the instru-ment detectors. On 13 Œ14 May the spacecraft conducted a maneuver with its thrusters to boost it out of orbit around L2 and into its final resting place in heliocentric orbit. (A possible end on the lunar surface was also contemplated but not cho-sen because of cost). Following a last maneuver 
to deplete the propellant on board, at 12:25 UT 264BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
on 17 June 2013, the final command to terminate communications was sent to Herschel, rendering the spacecraft dead. After a highly successful mis
-sion, the inert spacecraft will remain in heliocen-tric orbit. Scientists continued analyzing the vast amount of data returned from the observatory. For 
example, in January 2014, scientists announced that data from Herschel indicated the definitive 
detection of water vapor on the dwarf planet Ceres, a discovery which came prior to the arrival of NASA™s Dawn mission at Ceres. This research was 
part of the so-called Measurements of 11 Asteroids 
and Comets Using Herschel (MACH-11) program. The observatory is named after British astrono
-mers William Herschel (1738Œ1822) and his sister 
Caroline Herschel (1750Œ1848).220Planck

Scientific Instruments:1. low frequency instrument (LFI)2. high frequency instrument (HFI)3. telescopeResults: Both Herschel and Planck were launched by the same Ariane launch vehicle as ESA mis
-sions (although Herschel, especially, had signifi
-cant NASA contributions) but they had different science objectives. Planck, named after German physicist Max Planck (1858Œ1947) was the first European space observatory whose primary objective was to study the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The spacecraft used sensitive radio receivers operating at very low temperatures 
to determine the black body equivalent tempera-ture of the background radiation. Such measure-ments were then used to produce detailed maps of directional (anisotropic) temperature differences in the CMB radiation field, improving upon obser-vations made by NASA™s Wilkinson Microwave 
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)ŠPlanck had a higher resolution and sensitivity than WMAP. Besides 
mapping CMB anisotropies, Planck would also provide data to test inflationary models of the early 
universe, measure the amplitude of structures 
in the CMB, and perform measurements of the 
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (the distortion of CMB 
by high energy electrons through inverse Compton 
scattering). The Planck spacecraft was made up 
of two primary components, the payload and ser-vice modules. The former contained a telescope 
with primary and secondary mirrors that collected 
microwave radiation and directed it into the focal 
plane units. The octagonal service module (SVM) 
was common to both Herschel and Planck, both 
being cornerstone missions in ESA™s science pro
-gram (along with Rosetta and Gaia). Like Herschel, 
Planck was put into an elliptical orbit that even
-tually led to SunŒEarth L2 where it entered a 
Lissajous orbit with a 400,000-kilometer radius on 
3 July 2009. ESA announced that Planck™s High 
Frequency Instrument reached their low tempera
-tures of Œ273.05°C, making them the ﬁcoolestﬂ 
known objects in space. (This temperature is only 
0.1°C above absolute zero, the coldest temperature 
theoretically possible in our universe.) Such low 
temperatures are necessary to study CMB, the ﬁfirst 
lightﬂ released by the universe only 380,000 years 
after the Big Bang. This visible light gradually faded 
and moved to the microwave wavelengths due to the 
expansion of the universe. By studying, with Planck™s 
two instruments, patterns imprinted in that light 
today, scientists sought to understand the Big Bang 
and the very early universe. The spacecraft began 
its first ﬁall-skyﬂ survey on 13˜August working for 
two continuous weeks, generating excellent prelim-inary results within a month. On 15 January 2010, 
ESA extended the mission by 12 months (from 
2652009
 its original end point of late 2011). In July 2010, 
ESA reported that Planck had returned its first 

all-sky image, ﬁthe moment that Planck was con
-ceived for,ﬂ as ESA Director of Science and Robotic 
Exploration David Southwood (1945Œ ) noted. The 

image spanned the closest portions of the Milky 

Way to the ﬁfurthest reaches of space and time.ﬂ As 
expected, the High Frequency Instrument™s sensor 
ran out of coolant on 14˜January 2012, concluding 

its ability to detect this faint energy, but not before 

fully completing its survey of the early universe, i.e., 
the remnant of light from soon after the Big Bang 
itself. Based on data from Planck collected over its 

initial work spanning 15.5 months, in March 2013, 

ESA released the most detailed map ever created 
of the CMB. The map suggested that the universe 
is slightly older than earlier thought; the data points 

to an age of 13.798±0.037 billion years. In August 

2013, having completed its mission, Planck was 
ﬁnudgedﬂ away from its L2 orbit towards a more sta
-ble orbit around the Sun. Through September and 
October, mission controllers prepared the space
-craft for shutdown by using up its remaining fuel. 

Finally, at 12:10:27 UT, on 23 October 2013, ESA 
sent the final command to shut down Planck, end-ing a highly successful mission.221Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)

Robotic Program (which also included LCROSS) and was the first U.S. mission to the Moon in over 10 years. LRO™s primary goal was to make a 3D 

map of the Moon™s surface from lunar polar orbit 

as part of a high-resolution mapping program to identify landing sites and potential resources, 
investigate the radiation environment, and prove 
new technologies in anticipation of future auto-mated and human missions to the surface of the Moon. LRO was launched together with LCROSS; the Centaur upper stage boosted them both into 
high apogee orbits soon after launch. At 11:27 UT 

on 23 June 2009, LRO successfully entered orbit around the Moon, having fired its rocket motor 266BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
on the far side of the Moon. Initial orbital param-eters were roughly 30 × 216 kilometers. A series 
of four engine firings over the next four days left 
LRO in its optimal orbitŠroughly circular at 50 kilometersŠallowing the satellite to begin its pri-mary mission on 25 September 2009, expected to 
last one year and overseen by NASA™s Exploration 
Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD). During this period, LRO gathered information on day-night 
temperature maps, contributed data for a global geodetic grid, and conducted high-resolution imag-ing. The spacecraft paid particular emphasis to the polar regions, where constant solar illumination might be possible and where there is the possibil
-ity of water in the permanently shadowed regions. In September 2010, LRO operations were handed over to NASA™s Science Mission Directorate 
(SMD) to continue the science phase of the mis
-sion (rather than activities purely related to explo-ration and future missions) for another five years. Among LRO™s achievements was to take extremely 
high-resolution photographs of landing sites of sev-eral older lunar landers and impact vehicles, such as landing sites from all the Apollo landing missions 
(plus Surveyor III near the Apollo 12 site) and the 
Apollo 13, 14, 15, and 17 Saturn IVB upper stages. Other targets included the later Ranger impact 
probes (VI, VII, VIII, and IX), and the Soviet Luna 16, 17, 20, 23, and 24 soft-landers, and the Chinese Chang™e 3 lander/rover. In November 2011, NASA 
released the highest resolution near-topographical 
map of the Moon ever created, showing surface features over nearly the entire moon. An interac
-tive mosaic of the lunar north pole was published 
in March 2014. LRO also carried out the first 
demonstration of laser communication with a lunar satellite when, in January 2013, NASA scientists 
beamed an image of the Mona Lisa from the Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging (NGSLR) sta-tion at NASA™s Goddard Space Flight Center in 
Greenbelt, Maryland. to the LOLA instrument on board LRO. One of the LRO instruments, the Mini-RF partially failed in January 2011, although fortunately, it had already completed its primary 
science objectives by that time. On 4 May 2015, 
controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center sent commands to LRO to fire its engines twice to change its orbit, taking it closer to the Moon than beforeŠa polar orbit of about 20 × 165 kilome-ters. Perilune was close to the lunar South Pole. 
The new orbit allowed LRO™s LOLA instrument 
to produce better return signals and also allow it On June 10, 2011, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) took this dramatic view of the Tycho crater. The summit of the 
central peak is 2 kilometers above the crater ˛oor.

 to better measure specific regions near the South Pole that have unique illumination conditions. One 
of the more interesting finds of the orbiter was its identification, in December 2015, of the hitherto unknown impact site of Apollo 16™s S-IVB upper 
stage that was deliberately impacted on the lunar surface in 1972. In early 2017, LRO was still in excellent shape with propellant use limited to a few kilograms per year. Total remaining in early 2017 
was about 30 kilograms. It is not unlikely that the spacecraft will remain operational in its low ellipti-cal orbitŠwhich was about 30 × 150 kilometers in late 2016Šfor several more years.222Lunar Crater Observation and

Scientific Instruments:1. visible camera2. 2 near infrared cameras3. 2 mid-infrared cameras4. visible spectrometer5. 2 near infrared spectrometers6. total luminescence photometer (TLP)Results: The mission of Lunar Crater Observa-tion and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), like LRO, 
part of NASA™s now-cancelled Lunar Precursor 
Robotic Program, was to confirm the presence of 
water ice in a permanently shadowed crater at the 
Moon™s south pole. Notably, both missions were 
originally funded as part of NASA™s human space
-flight Constellation program to return humans to 
the Moon. Ancillary goals for LCROSS included 
the testing of new modular subsystems for poten-tial use in future mission architectures. Its mis
-sion profile involved impacting a Centaur upper 
stage on the surface of the Moon and then flying 
LCROSS through the debris plume about four min-utes later to collect data on the soil, and then itself 
impact a little later. LCROSS was launched along 
with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) 
and traveled to the Moon as a ﬁco-manifestedﬂ 
payload aboard the launch vehicle. The Centaur 
upper stage entered a 180 × 208-kilometer parking 
orbit before firing again at 22:15 UT on 18 June 
to reach a 194 × 353,700-kilometer orbit at 28.2° 
inclination. At that point, LRO separated from the 
Centaur-LCROSS combination, and the Centaur 
then vented some remaining propellant, which 
slightly altered its orbit to 133 × 348,640-kilometer 
orbit at 28.0° inclination, ensuring a lunar flyby. 
The combined Centaur-LCROSS then passed 
the Moon at a distance of 3,270 kilometers at 
10:29˜UT on 23˜June and entered into an Earth 
polar orbit at approximately 357,000 × 582,000 
kilometers at 45° inclination with an orbital period 
of 37 days. The combined stack reached apo
-gees near the Moon on 10 July, 16˜August, and 
22 September until its trajectory intersected with 
that of the Moon on 9˜October. A serious problem 
was discovered earlier, on 22˜August, when mis
-sion controllers found that a sensor problem had 
caused the spacecraft burning through 140 kilo-grams of propellant, more than half of the amount 
remaining at the time. The loss meant that the 
original mission could still be accomplished but 
with very little margin. At 01:50˜UT on 9 October, 
Centaur and LCROSS separated. The former then 
crashed onto the surface of the Moon at 11:31˜UT 
in the Cabeus crater at the lunar South Pole. 
The impact excavated roughly 350 (metric) tons 
of lunar material and created a crater estimated 
to be about 20 meters in diameter. Four minutes 
later, LCROSS flew through the resulting debris 
plume that rose above the lunar surface, collecting 
data before it itself struck the Moon at 11:36 UT 
268BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
at a velocity of 9,000 kilometers/hour. The LRO™s 
Diviner instrument obtained infrared observations 
of the LCROSS impact point as it flew by about 
90 seconds after the impact at a range of about 
80 kilometers. On 13 November 2009, NASA for-mally announced that data from LCROSS ﬁindi-cates that the mission successfully uncovered 
water – near the Moon™s south pole.ﬂ Nearly a 
year later, on 21˜October 2010, mission scientists 
announced new data, including evidence that the 
lunar soil within Cabeus was rich in useful materi-als (mercury, magnesium, calcium, silver, sodium) 
and that the Moon is chemically active and has 
a water cycle. They also confirmed that in some 
places the water on the south pole is in the form of 
pure ice˜crystals.2692010

270BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Results: This was Japan™s first interplanetary mis
-sion after Nozomi (launched in 1998), that space-craft having failed to enter orbit around Mars. The goal of Venus Climate Orbiter, or Akatsuki 
(ﬁdawnﬂ) as it was known after launch, was to 
investigate atmospheric circulation in Venus by 
globally mapping clouds and minor constituents with four cameras at ultraviolet and infrared wave-lengths, detect lightning, and observe the vertical structure of the atmosphere. A nominal mission 
would last two or more years in an elliptical orbit around Venus at 300 × 80,000 kilometers. The sci
-entific goals of VCO were closely related to those of ESA™s Venus Express launched in 2005. VCO 
was launched with a fleet of satellites, includ-ing three Japanese cubesats (KSAT, Negai*, and 
Waseda-Sat 2). The H-IIA rocket™s second stage 
restarted in Earth orbit to accelerate three other spacecraft to escape velocity: Akatsuki, UNITEC 
1, and IKAROS. On 21 May 2010, Akatsuki con
-ducted a mid-course correction to sharpen its tra-jectory to Venus orbit. This was the first time that 
a ceramic thruster (with 51 kgf thrust), made of silicon nitride, was used in space conditions. The spacecraft was supposed to enter Venus orbit by 
firing its orbital maneuvering engines at 23:40 UT on 6 December 2010. Although the engine fired 
on time, it apparently cut off early. When commu
-nications were reestablished with Akatsuki (after a 
planned blackout due to occultation), the space-craft was found to be in ﬁsafe modeﬂ and spin-stabilized, slowly rotating once every 10 minutes. 
A later investigation (whose results were issued on 30 June 2011) showed that the engine had fired for less than 3 minutes (instead of 12 minutes), thus providing insufficient delta-V to enter Venusian 
orbit. Apparently, salt deposits jammed a valve that 
delivered fuel to the combustion chamber, making 
the combustion oxidizer-rich. The thruster nozzle 
was probably damaged in the firing. Soon, JAXA scientists began devising a backup plan to enter Venusian orbit in November 2015, which would be 
possible if subsequent tests of thruster were suc-cessful. On 7 and 14 September 2011, test firings were carried out of the beleaguered engine which 
showed that the thrust was about one-ninth of normal (about 4.1 kg). As a result, a new plan was 
formulated to discard all the unused oxidizer (65 kilograms), lightening the spacecraft, and using the smaller reaction control system (RCS) thrusters to attempt Venus orbital insertion on 22 November 
2015. Three firings of the RCS system (587.5, 544, and 342 seconds in length) in November 2011 were successful in altering the trajectory of 
VCO for rendezvous with Venus in either 2015 
(preferable in terms of spacecraft lifetime) or 2016 
(preferable in terms of the original science mis-sion). The main problem at this time was VCO™s 
exposure to incredibly high temperatures as it sped through perihelionŠsix times by April 2014Šcon
-ditions it was not designed to survive, described by JAXA as ﬁthree times hotter than that of Earth.ﬂ 
Yet telemetry showed that the spacecraft was still 
functioning. In January 2015, the planned Venus 
orbit insertion was shifted to early December 2015 
with a possible apogee of 300,000 to 400,000 kilo-meters. As per the new plan, Akatsuki successfully 
entered orbit around Venus on 7 December 2015 
by using its attitude control thrusters for 20 min-utes, following earlier spacecraft from the former 
Soviet Union, the United States, and the European 
Space Agency. Initial orbital parameters were 
approximately 440,000 × 400 kilometers at 3° incli-nation and an orbital period of 13 days 14 hours, 
fortuitously much lower than mission planners 
had hoped to achieve in original pre-launch plan-ning. (Originally, the plan was to have an apoapsis 
of 79,000 kilometers and an orbital period of 30 
hours, partly to match the flow of Venusian winds 
for part of the spacecraft™s orbit.) The new orbit had 
one drawbackŠit meant that Akatsuki would be in 
Venus™ shadow for part of each day, longer than the 
90-minute limit set for the spacecraft. Remarkably, 
despite the stress from overheating, three of the five 
cameras on Akatsuki remained in perfect condition 
and sent back impressive imagery of the planet. On 
26˜March 2015, the vehicle lowered the high point 
of its orbit to about 330,000 kilometers, shortening 
2712010
 its orbital period to about nine days. After sev
-eral months of checkout, on 28˜April 2016, the 
spacecraft finally began its standard science mis
-sion. In March 2017, JAXA announced that two of the cameras, the 1-µm and 2-µm cameras) on Akatsuki had ﬁpause[d] scientific observationsﬂ as of 9˜December 2016 due to an electrical problem. 
Perhaps the most significant discovery of Akatsuki 
was the detection, in December 2015, of a bow-shaped feature in the Venusian atmosphere stretch
-ing about 9,600 kilometers from almost pole to pole, a feature which some have called a ﬁsideways smile.ﬂ In a paper published in January 2017 in Nature Geoscience, scientists suggested the ﬁsmileﬂ 
was the result of a gravity wave, a kind of distur-bance in Venusian winds that propagates upwards 
as a result of the topography on the surface. In September 2017, Japanese scientists announced, based on Akatsuki data, the discovery of an equato
-rial jet in the Venusian atmosphere. Like a number 
of other deep space vehicles, Akatsuki carried the 
names of people (260,214 names) printed in fine letters on an aluminum plate.224Shin™enNation: Japan (8)

Carrier 1 (UNITEC 1) was a Japanese student-built spacecraft designed for a flyby of Venus to study 
the effects of deep space travel on computers. Intended to be the first student spacecraft to oper-ate beyond geocentric orbit, it was built and oper
-ated by UNISEC (University Space Engineering Consortium), a collaborative program involving 20 Japanese universities developing nano-satellites. Known as Shin™en (ﬁabyssﬂ) after launch, the sat-ellite carried six computers, a camera, a radiation counter, a low-power communications system, and 
solar cells for power. The launch and transplane
-tary injection occurred without incident (see Venus 
Climate Orbiter). Shin™en was the last spacecraft 
to separate from the multi-satellite stack and enter heliocentric orbit. The plan was for it to fly past Venus in December 2010. Although signals from 
the spacecraft were received on the first day after 
launch, there was no further communication 
after 15:43 UT on 21 May 2010 when Shin™en 
was 320,000 kilometers from Earth. A beacon 
was tracked until 31 May when it also stopped.

Scientific Instruments:1. instrument to measure variation in dust density (ALADDIN)2. gamma-ray burst polarimeter (GAP)Results: One of the most unique and innovative missions in the history of deep space exploration, IKAROS (Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by 
Radiation of the Sun) was the world™s first space
-craft to use solar sailing as the main propulsion. 272BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
The mission was designed to demonstrate the 
deployment of a large (20 m diameter), square-shaped, and thin (7.5 micron) solar sail membrane, 
which had integrated into it thin-film solar cells to 
generate power for the main payload. It had instru-ments to measure the acceleration generated by 
radiation pressure. While radiation pressure consti-tuted the main form of propulsion, the spacecraft 
used variable reflectance LCD panels (80 of them) 
for smaller attitude control movements. The sail also 
carried the ALLADIN (Arrayed Large-Area Dust 
Detectors in Interplanetary Space) instrument, 
which was a network of eight ﬁchannelsﬂ or separate 
(polyvinylidene difluoride) PVDF sensors attached 
to the sail. Collectively they had a detection area 
of 0.54 m2, making it, according to JAXA, ﬁthe 
world™s largest dust detectorﬂ ever sent into space. 
ALLADIN™s goal was to count and time hyper
-velocity impacts by micrometeoroids larger than 
a micron in size during its 6-month voyage to the 
vicinity of Venus. Launched along with the Venus 
Climate Orbiter, IKAROS was sent on a trajectory 
to Venus with its co-payloads, VCO and Shin™en. 
After separation from the launch vehicle, IKAROS, 
shaped like a drum, was spun up to 5 rpms, then 
spun down to 2 rpm to deploy four ﬁtip massﬂ 
objects that uncoiled from the drum. At this point, 
on 3 June 2010, the ﬁquasi-staticﬂ stage of the sail 
deployment began. The spacecraft spun up to 25 
rpm and the membrane gradually unfurled through 
centrifugal force, slowing the central drum down to 
about 5Œ6 rpm once the four booms had reached to 
15-meter-diameter lengths by 8 June. The second 
stage, the ﬁdynamicﬂ phase of the deployment began 
at that point when a stopper was dislodged at the 
center, releasing in 5 seconds the entire membrane 
(which after deployment, took about 100 seconds to 
stop vibrating). By 10 June, the full membrane was 
deployed with the spacecraft spinning at 1Œ2 rpms. 
At this point, IKAROS was 7.7 million kilometers 
from Earth and actively generating power from its 
thin-film solar cells. Two small separation cameras 
(DCAM2 and DCAM1) were deployed on 15 and 
19 June, respectively, to take pictures of the solar 
sail. On 9˜July, JAXA announced that IKAROS was, 
indeed, being accelerated by the solar sail (at a value 
0.114 grams). On 13 July, the spacecraft success
-fully implemented attitude control using the LCDs 
on its solar panel, another first in the history of space 
exploration. IKAROS flew by Venus on 8 December 
2010 at a range of 80,800 kilometers, essentially 
completing its originally planned mission, which 
JAXA extended into the indefinite future. Slowly, 
attitude control degraded on IKAROS, making 
it more difficult to communicate with. In March 
2013, the IKAROS project team was disbanded but 
the project was reactivated three months later, on 
20 June 2013 and telemetry was received from that 
point until 12 September 2013. There was intermit-tent detection of transmissions in 2014, punctuated 
by long periods of hibernation. In mid-March 2015, 
IKAROS appeared to wake up from hibernation. 
On 23 April 2015, ground controllers found the 
spacecraft about 120 million kilometers from Earth. 
However, after last data reception on 21 May 2015, 
IKAROS entered hibernation mode again, for the 
fifth time, when the spacecraft was about 110 mil-lion kilometers from Earth.226Chang™e 2Nation: China (2)

 5. engine surveillance camera6. gamma-ray spectrometer7. x-ray spectrometer8. laser altimeterResults: The original mission of Chang™e 2 (or CE-2) was as backup to Chang™e 1 (CE-1), to basically 
repeat that mission with an improved suite of instruments. After Chang™e 1™s highly successful 
mission, additional tasks were attached to CE-2, 
such that this mission essentially became a path-finder mission to Chang™e 3 (CE-3), a landing mission. Unlike CE-1, CE-2 was launched on a more ambitious direct translunar trajectory (at 212 × 356,996 kilometers at 28.5° inclination), which required the more powerful Chang Zheng 
3C launch vehicle. A midcourse correction on 
2˜October 2010 was so accurate that further 
adjustments were unnecessary on the way to the Moon. The spacecraft successfully entered lunar orbit after 4 days and 16 hours of flight (as opposed to 12 days for CE-1) at an orbit of 120 × 80,000 kilometers. Three adjustments followed on 7, 8, and 9 October that resulted in CE-2 being in its operational circular orbit at 100 kilometers. All of 
its instruments, activated during the coast to the 
Moon, continued operations in lunar orbit with-out problems. On 26 October at 13:27 UT, CE-2 
fired its four 1 kgf thrusters for over 18 minutes to bring down perilune to 15 kilometers so that the spacecraft could photograph the planned land
-ing site of CE-3 in Sinus Iridum. It returned to its nominal orbit two days later after obtaining a large number of high resolution images of the sur-face, some down to 1.2 to 1.5 meters resolution. In February 2012, Chinese authorities released a full 
map of the Moon at 7 meters resolution, claimed at the time as the highest resolution map of the Moon. Of all recent probes to the Moon, only the photographs from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) had higher resolution. CE-2™s main lunar 
orbital mission concluded on 1 April 2012 but 
because the spacecraft still had a relatively large amount of maneuvering propellant still left, mis-sion planners decided in early 2013 to formulate an extended mission, one that would culminate with a flight to the SunŒEarth L2 Lagrange Point. 
By 23 May 2013, CE-2 completed a second survey of Sinus Iridium from a low altitude and filled in some surface details where earlier data was of rel-atively low detail. On 8 June 2011, CE-2 raised its apolune to 3,583 kilometers. The next day, CE-2™s 
main engine (50 kgf thrust) fired for 18 minutes, 
boosting the spacecraft out of lunar orbit. Finally, 
on 25 August 2011 at 15:24 UT, the 1 kgf thrusters 
fired to place CE-2 in a 180-day period Lissajous 
orbit around L2, about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. China thus became only the third country or entity (after the United States and ESA) to send a spacecraft to a Lagrange Point. There, Chang™e 2 
studied charged particles near Earth™s magnetic tail 
and observed possible x-ray and gamma-ray bursts from the Sun. The spacecraft departed L2 on 15˜April 2012 (although this was not announced by 
the Chinese until 14˜June) and headed for a flyby 
encounter with the asteroid 4179 Toutatis, about 
7 million kilometers from Earth. On 13 December 2012 at 08:30:09 UT, Chang™e 2 flew by Toutatis at 
a distance of just 1.9 kilometers (much better than the 30 kilometers hoped), making China the fourth nation or entity after the U.S., ESA, and Japan to perform an asteroid flyby. The encounter occurred 
at a relative velocity of 10.73 kilometers/second, giving very little time (about a minute) for useful imaging but some excellent pictures were returned. After the Toutatis encounter, CE 2 remains in helio
-centric orbit, with Chinese controllers maintaining contact in 2014 when the probe was as far as 100 million kilometers from Earth. On 23 October 2016, chief scientist for China™s Lunar Exploration 
Project, Ouyang Ziyuan, announced that Chang™e 2 had ﬁfulfilled its mission,ﬂ that it remained in helio
-centric orbit (apparently as ﬁthe smallest man-made 
asteroid in the solar system,ﬂ which was not true as some of NASA™s early Pioneers were smaller), and 
that the spacecraft would be returning ﬁsomewhere closer to the earth around 2029.ﬂ There was no word on whether the Chinese still maintained any contact with the spacecraft.2752011

6. ultraviolet imager/spectrometer (UVS)7. infrared imager/spectrometer (JIRAM)8. JunoCamResults: Juno, NASA™s second New Frontiers mis
-sion (after New Horizons), was designed to study 
Jupiter from polar orbit around the gas giant. Its 
specific science goals include studying the plan-et™s composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and 
polar magnetosphere, as well investigating the 
nature of the planet™s core, the amount of water in 
its atmosphere, mass distribution, and the winds 
in its clouds. Juno is the first mission to Jupiter 
not to use radioisotope thermoelectric generators 
(RTGs) for power and relies on three giant solar 
arrays symmetrically arranged around the space-craft that provide 450 watts of power in orbit 
around Jupiter. At launch, the optimal mission was 
planned to last about 14 Earth months in Jovian 
orbit. Juno entered parking orbit around Earth (at 
194 × 226 kilometers at 28.8° inclination) and 
then a hyperbolic escape orbit less than 45 min-utes after launch. As it headed outwards toward 
the asteroid belt, on 1 February 2012, Juno carried 
out its first mid-course correction, a firing last-ing 25 minutes. Further course corrections were 
implemented on 30 August and 14 September 
2012. The spacecraft passed the halfway point 
to Jupiter at 12:25 UT on 12 August 2013. Juno 
returned to the vicinity of Earth, using a grav-ity assist maneuver to pick up more speed, on 
8˜October 2013. Several of its instruments were 
activated as preliminary tests to see if they were 
in working condition. Twice after the flyby, Juno 
entered ﬁsafe modeﬂ and shut down all inessential 
systems but ground controllers were quickly able 
to return the spacecraft to normal operating mode. 
On 13 January 2016, Juno broke the record for the 
furthest distance from the sunŠ793 million kilo
-metersŠwhere a spacecraft has been powered by 
solar power. The record had previously been held 
by ESA™s Rosetta space probe and set in October 
2012. After a mid-course correction on 3˜February, 
on 27 May, Juno crossed from the primary grav
-itational influence of the Sun to that of Jupiter. 
A month later, on 30 June, Juno entered Jupiter™s 
magnetosphere. Finally, after an almost five-year 
trip, Juno fired its Leros-1b engine for 35 min-utes and 1 second (from 03:18 to 03:53 UT Earth 
receive time) and entered an elliptical and polar 
orbitŠknown as a ﬁcapture orbitﬂŠaround Jupiter 
of 8.1 million × 4,200 kilometers with an orbital 
period of 53.5 days. Five of its scientific instru-ments were powered up on 6 July with the rest 
activated by the end of the month. According to 
the original plan, Juno™s dedicated science mission 
276
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
was designed to begin only after two complete cap
-ture orbits, nearly two months after orbital inser
-tion, and after a minor orbital correction on 13 July. 
In its first capture orbit, Juno made its first pass 
through perijove (lowest point) on 27 August when 

it approached the gas giant at a range of only 4,200 

kilometers at 13:44 UT. This would be the closest 
the spacecraft would get to the planet during its 
primary mission, and it was the first time that its 

entire suite of scientific instruments was activated 

to study the planet as it flew by at a velocity of 
208,000 kilometers/hour. Just prior to the perijove 
flyby on 19 October, at about 06:47˜UT, Juno sud
-denly entered ﬁsafe modeﬂ when a software perfor-mance monitor caused a reboot of the spacecraft™s 
main computer. The switch to safe mode necessi
-tated a postponement of exit from capture orbit to 
a new orbit with a period of 14 days; the burn was 

postponed to allow engineers to verify the perfor-mance of two helium check valves in the space-craft™s fuel pressurization system (associated with 

its main engine). On 24 October, the spacecraft 

exited safe mode and carried out a 31-minute burn 

using its smaller thrusters to slightly adjust its 
orbit. Juno successfully carried out its third flyby 
of Jupiter on 11 December at 17:04 UT, at a range 

of 4,150 kilometers, this time focusing on investi-
gations on Jupiter™s interior structure via its gravity 
field. (Only the JIRAM instrument was inactive 
during the flyby). During the flyby, Juno™s JunoCam 

(a visible-light camera) captured spectacular 

images of one of Jupiter™s so-called eight ﬁstring of 
pearlsﬂŠlarge counterclockwise rotating storms in 
the planet™s southern hemisphere. For the fourth 

close flyby of Jupiter, at 12:57 UT on 2 February, 

NASA opened up an online vote for the public to 
choose in selecting what pictures should be taken. 
Juno™s perijove for this encounter was 4,300 kilo
-meters, while it was traveling at 57.8 kilometers/
second. About two weeks later on 17 February 
2017, NASA announced that Juno would remain 
in its 53-day capture orbit for the remainder of its 

primary mission and still be able to accomplish its 

science goals. Mission planners took this decision 
This stunning view of Jupiter was acquired by NASA™s 
Juno spacecraft on 19 May 2017 using its JunoCam from 

an altitude of 12,857 kilometers. Although the small bright 
clouds that dot the entire south tropical zone appear tiny, 
they are actually towers approximately 50 kilometers 

wide and 50 kilometers high that cast shadows below.

 to avoid firing Juno™s main engine due to concerns 
about the valves on the engine that did not operate 
as expected the previous October. There was con
-cern that firing the engine would put the vehicle 
in a ﬁless-than-desirableﬂ orbit. In its capture orbit, 
scientists believe that Juno can still complete its 
primary science mission in 12 orbits, performed 
through 2018. If the spacecraft is operational 
at that time, there will remain the option of an 
extended mission. The orbiter performed its fifth 
close pass of Jupiter on 18 May 2017, swooping 
down to about 3,500 kilometers above the plan-et™s clouds. All science instruments operated as 
planned. An even more spectacular flyby, its sixth, 
occurred on 10˜July, when Juno flew over the Great 
Red Spot at an altitude of 9,000 kilometers, just 
11 minutes and 33 seconds after reaching perijove 
(at 3,500 kilometers). The spacecraft remained in 
fine operation in the same orbit through its seventh 
(on 1˜September) and eighth (on 24 October) pass 
to perijove. As part of an educational program with 
the LEGO group, Juno carries three aluminum fig
-urines into outer space, each about 3.8 cm large, 
that of Galileo Galilei, the Roman god Jupiter, and 
his wife Juno. There is also a plaque, provided by 
the Italian Space Agency, dedicated to Galileo 
and including a facsimile of handwritten text by 
him. In June 2016, musicians Trent Reznor (of 
Nine Inch Nails) and Atticus Ross shared a nearly 
9-minute piece of music to celebrate the Juno mis-sion. The track originally scored NASA™s short film 
about Juno entitled ﬁVisions of Harmony.ﬂ

(GRAIL), the eleventh of NASA™s Discovery Pro
-gram, was a dual-spacecraft mission that involved 
placing two identical spacecraft in orbit around 
the Moon to use high-quality gravitational field 
mapping to determine its internal structure. As 
the two spacecraft flew over areas of greater and 
greater gravity, the probes moved slightly toward 
and away from each other, while an instrument 
measured changes in their relative velocity, pro
-viding key information on the Moon™s gravitational 
field. The nominal mission was planned to be 
three months. (The process used was very similar 
to the one employed by NASA™s Gravity Recov
-ery and Climate Experiment or GRACE since 
2001, which used a similar instrument to GRAIL™s 
LGRS). The spacecraft itself is a design evolu-tion of the U.S. Air Force™s Experimental Satellite 
System-11 (XSS-11) launched in 2005 while the 
avionics were derived from NASA™s Mars Recon
-naissance Orbiter (MRO). The names ﬁEbbﬂ and 
ﬁFlowﬂ were given to GRAIL-A and GRAIL-B, 
respectively after a national contest (won by the 
fourth grade students at Emily Dickinson Elemen
-tary School in Bozeman, Montana). GRAIL made 
use of a low-energy translunar cruise that involved 
passing near the SunŒEarth L1 Lagrange Point 
and then heading for a rendezvous with the Moon. 
The two spacecraft arrived in lunar orbit about 
25 hours apart, on 31 December 2011 (Ebb) and 
2˜January 2012 (Flow). The primary science phase 
of the two lunar satellites extended from 7 March 
to 29 May 2012. A second science phase, as part 
of the extended mission, was initiated on 8 August 
278BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
2012. Both spacecraft were then decommissioned 
and powered down in anticipation of deliberate 
impact onto the lunar surface which occurred on 
17 December 2012. Both Ebb and Flow impacted 
at 75.62° N / 26.63° W, crashing into the ground at 
1.68 kilometers/second. The outcome of the mis
-sion was a gravitational map of the Moon unprec-edented in its detail. In addition, the MoonKAM 
(Moon Knowledge Acquired by Middle school stu
-dents), a digital video imaging system, was used as 
part of the education and public outreach activ-ities of GRAIL. Each MoonKAM consisted of a 
digital video controller and four camera heads, one 
pointed slightly forward, two pointed below, and 
one pointed slightly backward. During the Ebb and 
Flow missions, MoonKam was operated by under-graduate students at the University of CaliforniaŒ
San Diego under the supervision of faculty, as well 
as Sally Ride Science, the foundation organized

-sion to the Martian system that had the goal of 
returning a sample (about 200 g) from Phobos. It 
was also the first Russian deep space/interplan
-etary mission since the failed mission of Mars 
8 in 1996, 15 years earlier. Besides the main 
Russian spacecraft (which included significant 
scientific contributions from ESA and several 
European countries), Fobos-Grunt also carried a 
small passenger payload, the Chinese Yinghuo-1 
Mars orbiter. The scientific goals of the mission 
included studying the physical and chemical 
characteristics of Phobos soil, the environment 
around Phobos, the seasonal and climatic varia-tions of the Martian atmosphere and surface, and 
testing out several new technologies. The space-craft was divided into three parts: a Flight Stage 
(PM), a Return Vehicle (VA)Šwhich included a 
Reentry Vehicle (SA)Šand the Main Propulsion 
Unit (MDU). After a voyage lasting about 10 
months, Fobos-Grunt would have entered a highly 
elliptical Martian orbit with an 80,000-kilometer 
apogee, sometime in August/September 2012. At 
this point, the MDU would have separated from 
the main spacecraft, along with the truss structure 
2792011
 and the Chinese payload. These three objects 
would have remained in a 900 × 77,000 equatorial 

kilometer orbit while the main Fobos-Grunt space
-craft (with the Flight Stage and Return Vehicle) 
would have made two major burns to move into 

a 9,900-kilometer circular orbit. Following sev
-eral more months in Mars orbit, the probe would 
have rendezvoused with Phobos, and then after 
a few more months, landed on its surface some-
time in January 2013. A robotic arm would have 

performed 15Œ20 scoops totaling about 85Œ156 
grams of soil, which would have been loaded into 
the Reentry Vehicle. The 287-kilogram Return 

Vehicle would then have taken off in April 2013 

and headed back to Earth while the lander would 
have continued its surface experiment program 
for about a year. On approach to Earth in August 

2014, the Return Vehicle would have released the 

7-kilogram Reentry Vehicle, which would have 
reentered Earth™s atmosphere, performing a hard 
landing (without a parachute) in the Sary Shagan 

test range in Kazakhstan. None of this happened. 

Within 2.5 hours after launch, at 22:55:48 UT, the 

MDU propulsion stage (derived from Fregat) was 
supposed to fire to insert the payload into an ellip-tical orbit. A subsequent burn would then send 

the probe towards Mars. At the time that the first 
burn would have finished, ground tracking stations 
were, however, unable to find Fobos-Grunt. Later, 

at 20:25 UT on 22 November, a tracking station 

belonging to ESA received a signal from the probe 
(after a command had been sent to turn on one 
of the transmitters on the spacecraft). After a fur
-ther brief communications session (with ESA) 

the next day and one with Russian stations on 
24 November, no further contact was established 
with Fobos-Grunt. ESA gave up attempts to con
-tact the probe on 2 December. American space 

assets tracked the probe in a 209 × 305-kilometer 
orbit in early December. The spacecraft and upper 
stage combination made an uncontrolled reentry 

on 15 January 2012, with wreckage apparently 

falling into the Pacific or parts of South America. 
An investigation later showed the probable cause 
of failure was a programming error that caused 

the simultaneous reboot of two channels of the 

onboard computer (TsVM22). The MDU never 

actually fired.A simpli˜ed illustration of the Russian Fobos-Grunt lander package. The half-spherical object at the top was the descent

Scientific Instruments:1. plasma package (including electron ana-lyzer, ion analyzer, mass spectrometer)
2. fluxgate magnetometer3. radio-occultation sounder4. optical imaging system (2 cameras)Results: This was a passenger payload on board 
the Russian Fobos-Grunt spacecraft, and a first 
attempt by the Chinese to test out an initial mis-sion in Mars orbit. Nominal orbital parameters 
were planned to be highly ellipticalŠthe low point 
would vary from 400 to 1,000 kilometers, while the 
high point would stretch out to 74,000 to 80,000 
kilometers. This would be an equatorial orbit (5° 
inclination) with an orbital period of 72.8 hours. 
The spacecraft had a design lifetime of about one 
year that it would use to study the surface, atmo-sphere, ionosphere, and magnetic field of Mars. 
The payload was carried on a Russian spacecraft 
as a result of an agreement signed by the Chinese 
and the Russians in March 2007. The plan was for 
Yinghuo-1 to be released from Fobos-Grunt once 
the latter entered Martian orbit. As described in 
the entry for Fobos-Grunt, although launched 
successfully, the Russian Martian probe never 
left Earth orbit. As such, there was no way for the 
Chinese to test the spacecraft in Mars orbit. Both 
Fobos-Grunt and Yinghuo-1 reentered Earth™s 
atmosphere on 15 January 2012.231 Curiosity

large (899 kilogram) rover called Curiosity and a ﬁsky craneﬂ descent stage to bring the rover down to the Martian surface. Both were fixed inside an aeroshell for entry into the Martian atmosphere. 
The principal goal of the mission is to assess whether Mars ever had an environment hospitable for lifeforms such as microbes. To do this, Curiosity 
carries the most advanced complement of instru-ments ever sent to the surface of Mars. The rover is designed to scoop up soil and rocks and investigate 2812011
 their formation, structure, and chemical composition 
in order to look for the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, 
nitrogen, oxygen, phospho-
rus, and sulfur). Curiosity is able to travel up to 90 meters per hour on its six-
wheeled rocker-bogie 

system, and is powered by a radioisotope power system to generate power 
from the heat of plutoni-um™s radioactive decay, 
which ensured an operat-ing lifetime of at least a full 
Martian year (687 Earth 
days). Curiosity operations depend heavily on the orbital communications 
capabilities of 2001 Mars 
Odyssey and Mars Recon-naissance Orbiter. The 
robot was named ﬁCuriosityﬂ after a nation
-wide student contest involving more than 9,000 

entries. The winning entry was submitted by Clara Ma, a sixth-grade student from Sunflower Elemen-tary School in Lenexa, Kansas. Curiosity™s expense, 
estimated at more than $1 billion, as well as the 
two-year delay in its launch, led to the institution of stronger requirements to maintain baseline cost and baseline schedules for future missions. After 

launch by an Atlas V 541 (powered by a Russian 

RD-180 engine), MSL was delivered into a 165 × 324-kilometer orbit around Earth at 35.5° inclina
-tion. At 15:33 UT, the Centaur upper stage fired to 

send the payloadŠthe cruise stage and MSLŠon 
a trajectory to Mars. MSL used a unique entry, 
descent, and landing (EDL) profile, designed to 
accommodate for the fact that the Martian atmo-
sphere is too thin for regular parachutes and stan-dard aerobraking but too thick for deceleration 
with rockets. MSL™s relatively heavy weightŠ

much heavier than anything ever landed on 
MarsŠpresented engineers with some serious 
challenges. The EDL used by MSL was entirely 

autonomous without ground intervention and 

involved four separate stages: guided entry, para
-chute descent, powered descent, and sky crane 

landing, all of which took a total of only 7 minutes 

on 6 August 2012. The guided entry within the 

aeroshell was helped by small attitude control jets 
that narrowed the landing ellipse for MSL to a 20 
× 7-kilometer area. Having slowed down to Mach 

1.7, a supersonic parachute deployed (similar to 

those on Viking, Mars Pathfinder, and MER). The 
heat shield (from the aeroshell) was then dis-carded, and at about 1.8 kilometers altitude, with 
velocity down to 100 meters/second, the actual 

descent stage with Curiosity underneath it was

released from the aeroshell, and eight variable 
thrust monopropellant hydrazine thrusters fired to 
slow the payload down further until Curiosity was slowly lowered from the descent stage with a 7.6-meter tether known as the sky crane system. The 
rover was then gently brought down to the surface 
at 05:17 UT on 6 August 2012. Just 2 seconds after 
the rover touched down, the sky crane/descent 
stage was freed and flew away and crashed about 
650 meters away. Curiosity landed at Gale Crater, 

a 154-kilometer diameter impact crater estimated to be 3.5Œ3.8 billion years old. The precise landing 
coordinates are 4.5895° S / 137.4417° E. NASA 

named the landing site Bradbury Landing site after 
Ray Bradbury (1920Œ2012), author of The Martian Chronicles. On 15 August, Curiosity began initial 

instrument and mobility checks (including a test of 
the laser on a rock using the ChemCam instrument 
on 19 August). The rover began its first drive on 
29˜August, slowly taking about two months to cross 
about 400 meters east to a location named Glenelg. 
During the fall of 2012, Curiosity identified several 
interesting rocks that it investigated using both the MAHLI and APXS instruments. An area called 
ﬁRocknestﬂ was also identified as an area to test out 

the scoop on the rover™s remote arm. On 27 

September 2012, NASA announced that Curiosity 
had found hints of an ancient streambed, indicat-ing that there might have been a ﬁvigorous flowﬂ of water on Mars. On 27 October 2012, Curiosity 
conducted its first x-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil, and on 3 December, NASA announced 
the results of Curiosity™s first extensive soil analy
-sis, which had revealed the presence of water mol-ecules, sulfur, and chlorine. The small amounts of 
carbon detected could not be properly sourced and might have been from instrument contamination. 
More conclusively, in March 2013, NASA 

announced the data from the rover (based on an investigation of the so-called ﬁJohn Kleinﬂ rock) This low-angle self-portrait of NASA™s Curiosity rover shows the vehicle at the site from which it reached down to drill 
into a rock target called ﬁBuckskin.ﬂ Bright powder resulting from that drill, carried out on 30 July 2015, can be seen in

 suggested that Gale Crater was once suitable for microbial life. The result of further analysis showed 
the existence of water, carbon dioxide, sulfur diox
-ide, and hydrogen sulfide. In terms of rover opera
-
tions, on 28˜February 2013, the rover™s active 

computer™s flash memory developed a problem that 

made the computer reboot in a loop. As a result, 
controllers switched to the backup computer that 
became operational on 19 March. After drilling a 

rock in February, Curiosity drilled its second rock 

(ﬁCumberlandﬂ) on 19 May 2013, generating a hole about 6.6 centimeters deep and delivering the material to its laboratory instruments. In early July 
2013, Curiosity exited the Glenelg area and began 
a long trek to the mission™s main destination, 
Mount Sharp. A long drive on 17 July of 38 meters 
meant that Curiosity had now traveled a total dis-tance of 1 kilometer since it landed. As Curiosity 

continued toward Mount Sharp, NASA announced further findings. On 19 September 2013, scientists revealed that data from Curiosity of samples of the 
atmosphere taken six times from October to June 2012, confirmed that the Martian environment 
lacks methane, suggesting that there is little chance 
that there might be methanogenic microbial activ
-ity on Mars at this time. At the end of the year, on 
7 November, the rover abruptly reverted to ﬁsafe 
modeﬂ (apparently due to a software error) but con-
trollers revived the vehicle within three days to 
resume nominal surface operations. Later, on 
17˜November, there was a spurious voltage prob
-lem that suspended work for a few days. By 
5˜December, the rover™s ChemCam laser instru
-ment had been used for more than 100,000 shots fired at more than 420 different rock or soil targets. Through the next few months, Curiosity returned 
many spectacular images (including of Earth in the 

Martian night sky). One image returned in April 
2014 showed both Ceres and Vesta. In May 2014, 
Curiosity drilled into a sandstone slab rock 
(ﬁWindjanaﬂ), the third time on its traverse, this 

time at a waypoint along the route towards the mis-sion™s long-term destination on the lower slopes of 

Mount Sharp. Curiosity passed its two-year mark 

on Mars on 5˜August 2014, having already far 

exceeded its original objectives. In August 2014, 

Curiosity was about to make its fourth drilling 
experiment but mission planners decided not to at 
the last minute as it was thought that the rock 

(ﬁBonanza Kingﬂ) was not stable enough. Finally, on 

11 September 2014, Curiosity arrived at the slopes 
of Mount Sharp (or Aeolis Mons), now 6.9 kilome
-ters away from its landing point. In less than two 

weeks, on 24 September 2014, the rover™s hammer
-ing drill was used to drill about 6.7 centimeters into 
a basal-layer outcrop on Mount Sharp and collected 
the first powdered rock sample from its ultimate 

target. Perhaps the most striking announcement of 

the mission was made on 16˜December 2014, when 
NASA scientists announced that Curiosity had 
definitively identified the first instance of organic 

molecules on Mars. These were found in a drilled 

sample of the Sheepbed mudstone in Gale Crater. 
While these could be from organisms, it is more

likely that the substance is from dust and meteor-ites that have landed on the planet. At the same 
time, new data showed that there was a recent ten
-fold spike and then decrease in the abundance of 

methaneŠstill very tinyŠin the Martian atmo
-sphere. Curiosity was visible in a photograph taken 
on 13 December 2014 by the HiRISE camera on 
board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO); the image clearly showed the rover as it was examining 
part of the basal layer of Mount Sharp inside Gale 
Crater. A later image, from 8 April 2015, also 
showed Curiosity very clearly on the lower slope of Mount Sharp. In late January 2015, Curiosity used 
a new, low-percussion-level drilling technique to 

collect sample powder from a rock target called 
Mojave 2. Preliminary results (based on analysis by 
the CheMin instrument) suggested more acidic qualities in the form of jarosite, than previous drilled samples. On 24 February, Curiosity used its 

drill for the sixth time, this time to collect sample 
powder from inside a rock known as Telegraph 
Peak that was resting on the upper portion of 
Pahrump Hills (also the site for the two previous 

drilling experiments). Three days later, Curiosity 

experienced a so-called ﬁfault-protection actionﬂ 
that stopped the robot from transferring sample material between devices because of an ﬁirregular-ityﬂ in the electric current. After a series of tests 
running through early March, mission planners 
finally directed the robotic arm to resume its work on 11 March and have it deliver the sample to the CheMin analytic instrument. Later in March, sci-entists published results (in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science
) from the SAM instru-ment suite that indicated for the first time the exis-tence of nitrogen on the surface of Mars released during the heating of Martian sediments. The 
nitrogen, which NASA called ﬁbiologically usefulﬂ was in the form of nitric oxide, perhaps released from the breakdown of nitrates. The discovery 
added more weight to the argument that ancient 
Mars might have been ﬁhabitable for life.ﬂ On 16˜April, Curiosity passed the 10-kilometer mark 
on its travels as it moved through a series of shallow 
valleys between Pahrump Hills and Logan Pass, its 

next science destination. Curiosity resumed full 
operations after a period of limited activity for most 
of June when Mars passed nearly behind the Sun (relative to Earth). In late July, the rover found 

unusual bedrock in a target named Elk, one with 

unexpectedly high level of silica, which suggests conditions suitable for preserving ancient organic material. On 12 August 2015, Curiosity finally fin
-ished its work at Marias Pass, where it had been 

since May, and where it had drilled a rock target 
named Buckskin and found rocks with high silica and hydrogen content. It then headed upward and Visible at the bottom (the thick vertical rod) is the Rover 
Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) built by the 

Centro de Astrobiologia (CAB) in Madrid, Spain. The pen

 southwest up Mount Sharp. Much later, in June 
2016, scientists published results from an investi-gation of Buckskin noting that the silica mineral in 
question was tridymite, a material generally linked 
to silicic volcanism. Continuing its studies at Mount Sharp, on 29 September 2015 Curiosity 
drilled its eighth hole (and fifth at Mount Sharp), one that was 65-mm deep in a rock known as Big Sky as part of an experiment to analyze Martian rocks in both the CheMin and SAM instrument suites. New results from Curiosity, published in 
October 2015, confirmed that billions of years ago there were definitely water lakes on Mars. Scien-tists determined that water helped deposit sedi-ment into Gale Crater, and the sediment was 
deposited as layers that formed the foundation for 
Mount Sharp, the mountain in the middle of Gale. At the end of the year, in December 2015, Curiosity 
began close examination (and returned spectacular images) of dark sand dunes up to two stories tall, located at Bagnold Dunes, a band along the north-western side of Mount Sharp. Through the subse-quent few weeks, the rover took several samples 
from the Samib Dune, that were sorted by grain size for closer studies. Moving on from the dunes in early March, Curiosity climbed onto the Naukluft Plateau on the lower side of Mount Sharp, ending up in a stretch of extremely rugged and difficult-to-navigate terrain, whose bedrock was shaped by long periods of wind erosion into ridges and knobs. Here, the rover continued to take 
drill samples (its 10th and 11th). On 2 July 2016, Curiosity suddenly entered into safe standby mode, but controllers were able to return it to normal 
operations a week later. The cause of the original 
switch to safe mode was a software ﬁmismatchﬂ in a particular mode, involving writing images from some cameras™ memories into files on the rover™s 
main computer. Among the many thousands of 
images returned by Curiosity, some of the most 
spectacular were those of the Murray Buttes region of lower Mount Sharp. Color images showed beau-tiful vistas not unlike ﬁa bit of the American desert 
southwest,ﬂ according to Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada. Curiosity began a 
second two-year extended mission on 1 October 2016, continuing its explorations of lower Mount 
Sharp. At that point, the rover had returned more 
than 180,000 images to Earth; NASA declared that the mission ﬁhas already achieved its main goal of determining whether the landing region ever 
offered environmental conditions that would have been favorable for microbial life.ﬂ Engineers put a 
halt on using the rover™s drill soon after, while 
taking what would have been the seventh drill sample of the year. On 1 December, the Curiosity 
team discovered that the rover had not completed the commands for drilling; apparently, the rover 
had detected a fault in the ﬁdrill feed mechanismﬂ 
which was supposed to extend the drill to touch the rock target. This problem remained unresolved until May 2018 when a new method of ﬁpercus-siveﬂ drilling finally opened the path to further use 
of the instrument. Despite the problem with the drill, Curiosity was once again investigating active 
sand dunes (the so-called Bagnold Dunes). As of 
23˜February 2017, Curiosity had driven 15.63 kilo
-meters since landing. By this time, it was clear to NASA engineers that the zig zag treads on Curiosity™s wheels were suffering damage, jeopar
-dizing the wheels™ ability to carry the weight of the 
rover. Damage to only three treads (or ﬁgrousersﬂ) 
would indicate that the wheel had reached 60% of its lifetime. Lessons from damage to Curiosity™s 
wheels will play a major role in the design of future Mars rovers. In March 2017, JPL controllers uploaded a software for traction control that helped 
the rover adjust wheel speed depending on the rocks it is climbing. The traction control algorithm uses real-time data to vary the wheel speed, thus reducing pressure from the rocks. ﬁArmedﬂ with the new software, in July, Curiosity began a cam
-paign to study a ridge on lower Mount Sharp, infor-mally named Vera Rubin Ridge after the recently 
departed astronomer, Vera Florence Cooper Rubin 
(1928Œ2016). The ridge was thought to be rich in an iron-oxide mineral known as hematite that can form under wet conditions. Two months later, the 
286BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
rover began making a steep ascent toward the ridge top. On 17 October 2017, for the first time in 10 
months, the rover cautiously touched its sampler drill to a surface rock. While it was still several 
months away from resuming full-scale drilling 
operations on the Martian surface, this and subse-quent tests allowed ground controllers to test tech-niques, including using the motion of the robotic arm directly to advance the extended bit into the rock, thus working around the mechanical problem that suspended drill work. NASA made some sig-nificant attempts to involve the public in the Curiosity mission. On the third anniversary of 
landing on Mars, in August 2015, the Agency made 
available two online tools for public engagement. Mars Trek was a free web-based application that 
provides high-quality visualizations of the planet derived from 50 years of NASA exploration of Mars, while Experience Curiosity was a platform to allow viewers to experience in 3D, movement along the surface of Mars based on data from both 
Curiosity and MRO. Around the time of Curiosity™s 
third anniversary on Mars, in August 2016, NASA 
also released a social media game, Mars Rover, for 
use on mobile devices where users can drive a rover through Martian terrain while earning points.2872013

Scientific Instruments:1. ultraviolet and visible light spectrometer (UVS)2. neutral mass spectrometer (NMS)3. lunar dust experiment (LDEX)4. lunar laser communications demonstration experiment (LLCD)Results: The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Envi
-ronment Explorer (LADEE), the first mission in 
the Lunar Quest series, was designed to orbit the 
Moon and study its thin atmosphere and the lunar 
dust environment, specifically to collect data on the 
global density, composition, and time variability of 
the exosphere. By studying the Moon™s exosphereŠ
an atmosphere that is so thin that its molecules 
do not collide with each otherŠLADEE™s instru
-ments helped further the study of other planetary 
bodies with exospheres such as Mercury and some 
of Jupiter™s moons. After insertion into low park
-ing around Earth after launch from the Wallops 
Flight FacilityŠthe first lunar launch from that 
locationŠMinotaur™s fifth stage (with a Star 37FM 
solid motor) fired at 03:43 UT to boost the payload 
into a highly elliptical Earth orbit of 200 × 274,600 
kilometers at 37.7° inclination. LADEE took a path 
to lunar orbit used by several other recent lunar 
spacecraft that involved flying increasingly larger 
Earth orbits (in this case, three orbits) over a period 
of a month, with the apogee increasing until it was 
at lunar distance. On the third orbit, on 6˜October, 
as LADEE approached the Moon, it fired its own 
engine and entered into an initial elliptical lunar 
orbit with a 24-hour period. On 9 and 12 October, 
further burns brought LADEE down into a 235 × 
250-kilometer orbit. These events occurred exactly 
during the period when the U.S. GovernmentŠand 
therefore NASAŠshut down briefly, opening back 
up on 16˜October. One of the early experiments was 
use of the LLCD system, carried out on 18 October 
2013 when the spacecraft, using the optical laser 
system, transmitted good data to a ground station 
385,000 kilometers away. Finally, on 20 November, 
LADEE successfully entered its planned equatorial 
orbit of 20 × 60 kilometers, allowing the probe to 
make frequent passes from lunar day to lunar night. 
When the Chinese Chang™e 3 lunar lander arrived 
at the Moon, LADEE (more specifically, it™s NMS 
neutral mass spectrometer) was used to observe the 
specific masses of the substances (such as water, 
nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen) that 
would be expected to be found given the operation 
of Chang™e™s operation in near-lunar space. In the 
event, LADEE™s data found no effectsŠno increase 
in dust, no propulsion products, etc.Šthat could 
be attributed to Chang™e 3. Another experiment 
that involved another spacecraft was NASA™s Lunar 
Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) taking a photo of 
LADEE in orbit at 01:11˜UT on 15 January 2014. 
Its 100-day science mission, during which LADEE 
collected an enormous amount of data, came for-mally to an end by early March 2014. The three sci-ence payloads worked fulltime during this period: 
288BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
the UVS instrument acquired more than 700,000 
spectra of the exosphere. The NMS instrument 
positively identified argon-40 in the atmosphere 
(first identified by an Apollo surface experiment 
40 years before). Finally, the LDEX recorded more 
than 11,000 impacts from dust particles from a dust 
cloud engulfing the Moon. In early 2014, LADEE 
began to gradually lower its orbital altitude in antic-ipation of its final impact on the Moon. Controllers 
lowered LADEE™s orbit to within 2 kilometers of 
the lunar surface to ensure impact. On its penul-timate orbit, on 17 April, LADEE swooped down 
to as low as 300 meters of the lunar surface, and 
contact was lost at 04:30˜UT on 18˜April when it 
moved behind the Moon. Controllers estimated 
that the spacecraft probably struck the Moon on 
the eastern rim of Sundman V crater between 04:30 
and 05:22˜UT at a speed of 5,800 kilometers/hour. 
Later, on 28˜October 2014, NASA announced 
that its LRO spacecraft had successfully imaged 
the impact location of LADEE on the far side of 
the˜Moon.233Mangalyaan / Mars Orbiter

Results: India™s first interplanetary spacecraft was 
designed and built in a relatively short period of 
time, with a total development time of 4 years and 
2 months, although official government approval 
came as late as August 2012. The main space
-craft bus was a modified I-1 bus used on the 
lunar Chandrayaan-1 mission. The mission was 
essentially a technology demonstrator although it 
carried a set of modest scientific instruments to 
study the surface features, morphology, mineralogy, 
and Martian atmosphere. With the mission, India 
accomplished a remarkable feat, becoming only the 
fourth nation or agency to have a spacecraft orbit 
Mars, after the former Soviet Union, the United 
States, and the European Space Agency. Japan had 
tried and failed, while a Chinese rocket had yet to 
launch a probe to Mars (although its Yinghuo-1 
orbiter launched by the Russians failed to leave 
Earth orbit due to the malfunctioning Russian 
upper stage). The name Mangalyaan was formally 
attached to the mission before launch while in the 
development period the spacecraft was known var-iously as the Mars Orbiter Spacecraft, the Mars 
Orbiter Satellite, or the Mars Orbiter Mission. 
Mangalyaan entered an initial orbit around Earth at 
251 × 23,892 kilometers at 19.4° inclination. The 
mission profile to Mars involved six engine burns 
(the fourth on 10˜November was partially suc
-cessful) over a month in progressive larger Earth 
orbits to accumulate sufficient velocity to escape 
Earth™s sphere of influence. A seventh engine 
burn lasting over 22 minutes, beginning at 19:19 
UT on 30 November, inserted Mangalyaan into 
heliocentric orbit. On the way to Mars, the space-craft conducted three mid-course corrections (on 
11˜December 2013, 11˜June, and 22 September) 
before a successful burn (lasting over 23 minutes) 
of the main 44.9 kgf thrust engine put the probe 
into Mars orbit on 24˜September 2014. This was 
a highly elliptical orbit at 421.7 × 76,993.6 kilo-meters with an orbital period of nearly 73 hours. 
Mangalyaan returned its first global image of Mars, 
a spectacular picture captured by the MCC instru-ment, on 28 September 2014 from an altitude of 
2892013
 74,580 kilometers with about a 4-kilometer reso-lution that showed various morphological features 
and thin clouds in the Martian atmosphere. The 
ground team maneuvered the spacecraft to avoid a 
possible encounter with Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding 
Spring) which passed by Mars on 19 October 2014, 
one of seven spacecraft on or around Mars that had 
to take measures to prevent damage. The comet 
passed by Mars at a range of about 132,000 kilo-meters shedding material around Mars, some at a 
velocity of 56 kilometers/second putting many of 
these spacecraft in danger. Mangalyaan™s instru
-ments remained fully operational through late 2014, 
and on 1 January 2015 ISRO scientists marked 100 
days of successful operations around Mars. Mission 
planners were confident that the spacecraft would 
meet its planned lifetime of six months or 180 days 
in orbit around Mars. As with many other space
-craft in and around Mars, Mangalyaan was sub-jected to a communications blackout in June 2015 
when Mars™ orbit took it behind the Sun relative 
to Earth. Mangalyaan commemorated a success-ful operational year orbiting Mars in September 
2015 although at the time, scientific results from 
its instruments had yet to be publicly shared. The 
13 pictures released by that time were largely 
taken in September and October 2014 although, 
because of MOM™s unique orbit, they show the 
kind of wide-angle images have rarely been seen 
from Mars orbit. Finally, in March 2016, scientists 
published the first results (in Geophysical Research 
Letters) of the MENCA instrument. Further results 
from other instruments were made available in the 
fall of 2016. Newly released images included some 
of the most spectacular views from orbit showing 
many surface patterns. One note of concern was a 
possible problem with the MSM methane sensor, 
data from which has yet to be released. There were 
some reports that the sensor itself had a design flaw. 
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center scientists had 
apparently briefed ISRO personnel on the problem 
in February 2016 and suggested that the instru
-ment instead be repurposed for albedo mapping 
and measuring reflected sunlight. On 17˜January 
2017, ISRO controllers changed Mangalyaan™s 
orbit as a strategy to avoid the eclipse season when the spacecraft would be in Mars™ shadow for as 
much as 8 hours per day. The burn used about 
20 kilograms of propellant, leaving 13 kilograms remaining for further maneuvers. It is hoped that the spacecraft can transmit data until˜2020.234MAVEN

the loss of volatiles from the Martian atmosphere has affected the Martian climate over time, and 
thus contribute to a greater understanding of terres-trial climatology. The Mars Scout Program involved 

low cost spacecraft (less than $450 million) but 
was cancelled in 2010 after approval of MAVEN 

and the Phoenix lander. Further Mars missions 
would now be selected competitively under the Discovery Program. Because of a U.S. Government 
shutdown in the fall of 2013, MAVEN nearly 

didn™t get off the ground. Fortunately, MAVEN was 
defined as part of ﬁcritical infrastructure,ﬂ allowing the launch to proceed on time on 18 November 
2013. The payload successfully reached a 167 × 
315-kilometer parking orbit around Earth (at 26.7° inclination). Soon, the Centaur upper stage (with its RL-10A-4-2 engine), fired the spacecraft into 
a hyperbolic Earth orbit at 195 × 78,200 kilome
-ters at 27.7° inclination. On 21 November, another 
burn inserted the spacecraft on a Trans-Mars 

trajectory, with further mid-course corrections 

on 3˜December 2013 and 27 February 2014. At 
03:24˜UT on 21˜September 2014, MAVEN success
-fully entered orbit around Mars after a 10-month 
journey when its six main engines fired, two by two 

in succession, and burned for 33 minutes and 26 
seconds to slow the craft. The spacecraft entered 
a six-week commissioning phase before beginning 

science operations. The initial orbital period was 
35.02 hours. The primary mission, in an orbit with a period of 4.5 hours, included five ﬁdeep-dipﬂ campaigns, during which MAVEN™s periapsis was 

lowered from 150 kilometers to about 125 kilo-meters to collect data on the boundary between the upper and lower atmosphere. By mid-October 
all of its scientific instruments were turned on.

 on 19˜October, controllers took precautions to pro
-tect MAVEN from damage. In the event, MAVEN 
survived without any damage, and also returned 
valuable data on the comet™s effects on the Martian 
atmosphere. MAVEN began its one-year primary 
science mission on 16 November, carrying out reg
-ular observations of the Martian upper atmosphere, 
ionosphere, and solar-wind interactions with its 
nine scientific instruments. MAVEN completed 
the first of its five ﬁdeep-dipﬂ maneuvers between 
10 and 18 February 2015. As with most of these 
dives, the first three days were used to lower the 
periapsis, with the remaining five days used for sci-entific investigations over roughly 20 orbits. Given 
that the planet rotates under the spacecraft, the 
20 orbits allow the opportunity to explore different 
longitudes spaced around Mars, essentially giving 
it a global reach. The following month, based on 
data collected in December 2014, mission scien-tists announced that they had detected two unan-ticipated phenomena in the Martian atmosphere, 
one involving a high-altitude dust cloud (at about 
150Œ300 kilometers altitude) and the other, a 
bright ultraviolet auroral glow in the northern hemi-sphere. Like all the other probes in orbit or on the 
surface of Mars, communications with MAVEN 
were put on hold during the Mars conjunction in 
June 2015. MAVEN commemorated a year in orbit 
in September 2015 by which time it had carried 
out four deep dive campaigns. By this time, NASA 
had approved an extended mission past November. 
In a major reveal in November 2015, scientists 
published the results (in the journals Science and 
Geophysical Research Letters) of their analysis of 
data from MAVEN, which identified the processes 
that contributed to the transition of the Martian 
climate from an early, warm, and wet environment 
that might have supported surface life to the cold 
and dry world at the present. More specifically, the 
information helped to determine the most accurate 
rate at which the Martian atmosphere was cur-rently losing gas to space via ﬁstrippingﬂ to the solar 
wind. In late November and early December 2015, 
MAVEN made a series of close flybys of Phobos, 
coming within 500 kilometers of its surface, and 
collecting spectral images using the IUVS instru-ment. On 3 October 2016, MAVEN completed an 
entire Mars year of scientific observations. The fol
-lowing year, on 28˜February 2017, MAVEN carried 
out a small orbital maneuver, the first of its kind, 
to avoid a possible impact with Phobos. During 
MAVEN™s second Martian year in orbit, through 
2017, research was being coordinated with simul-taneous atmospheric observations by ESA™s Trace 
Gas Orbiter.

2. lunar penetrating radar (LPR)3. imaging spectrometer (VIS-NIR)4. active particle induced x-ray spectrometer (APXS)Results: Launched as part of the second phase of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, Chang™e 3 
was the most sophisticated robotic probe launched by the Chinese to date. The spacecraft included a four-legged soft-lander and a small rover named 
Yutu (ﬁJade Rabbitﬂ) to traverse the lunar surface. 
The 765-kilogram lander was based around an 292BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
octagon-shaped body with four legs, a throttleable engine at the bottom, refoldable solar panels, a 
radioisotope heater unit to generate heat, and three engineering monitoring cameras at the top. The lander™s mission lifetime was one year. Besides the 

technological objectives of the mission, the lander 
and rover also had some scientific objectives includ-ing investigating the lunar topography and geolog-ical structure of the Moon; studying the material 
composition of the lunar surface; surveying the 

space environment between the Moon, Earth, and Sun; and carrying out astronomical observations from the lunar surface. The launch was marred by 
hardware from the rocket that landed on villages 
downrange from the launch site, although no one was hurt. The payload was inserted directly into a 
lunar transfer orbit of 210 × 389,109 kilometers at 28.5° inclination. After two mid-course correc
-
tions (on 2 and 3 December), the spacecraft fired 
its engine at 09:41 UT for 6 minutes and entered a 100-kilometer circular orbit around the Moon. On 10 December, Chang™e 3 lowered is orbit to a 15 × 

100-kilometer orbit. When it reached perilune on 
14 December, its engine fired at 13:00 UT for a 
powered descent to the lunar surface (apparently one orbit earlier than planned, probably to ensure 
a live broadcast on Chinese TV). The 11-minute 
landing sequence was punctuated by a ﬁhazard avoidance maneuverﬂ about 100 meters above the surface. The main engine cut out at 4 meters above 
the surface, and the lander settled down natu-rally the rest of the way, landing at 13:11 UT, thus 
becoming the first spacecraft to soft-land on the Moon since the Soviet Luna 24 in 1976. Landing Image taken on 13 January 2014 by the panoramic camera (PCAM) on board the Chinese Yutu lunar rover as it looked

 coordinates were announced as 19.51°˜W˜/ 
44.12°˜N, in the northwestern portion of Mare 

Imbrium which, as is turns out was different than what was announced earlierŠSinus Iridum. Immediately after landing, Chang™e 3 deployed its 
solar panels. Soon, a command was sent to Yutu to 

deploy its two solar panels and unlock its wheels. 
Yutu was a 6-wheeled mobile spacecraft capable of 
transmitting video in real time and able to perform 

relatively simple soil analyses. Like the lander, the 

rover had its own radioisotope heater units (using plutonium-238) for heating. It also had sensors that enabled it to automatically negotiate over obstacles 
on the surface. Its original planned lifetime was 
three months, during which it was expected to travel an area of 3 square kilometers. At 20:10˜UT 
on 14 December, the rover began to slowly move 
toward the rover transfer mechanism, which then 
slowly lowered itself until its tracks touched the 
lunar surface. At 20:35 UT, the rover wheeled 
down and touched the surface. The rover remained at Point A, about 10 meters north of the lander for 

about 13 hours until it turned around and cameras 
on the rover and lander took pictures of each other on 15 December. The rover then slowly moved to 
Point B and entered into sleep mode for four days. 

Woken up on 20 December, Yutu traveled about 

21 meters from Point B to C and then to Point 
D, testing its robotic arm on 23 December. Both 
lander and rover entered into hibernation mode on 
25 and 26 December, respectively, in anticipation 

of the lunar night. On 11Œ12 January the lander and Yutu were brought out of sleep to begin their 
second lunar day. The rover, however, ran into a

major problem later in the month; on 25 January, 
the Chinese media announced that Yutu had suf
-fered a ﬁmechanical control anomalyﬂ caused by the ﬁcomplicated lunar surface environment.ﬂ 
Because the problem occurred just before the rover was entering hibernation for its second lunar night, 
controllers had to wait until hibernation was over to confirm the problem. After failing to hear from 
the rover on 10 February, ground controllers estab
-lished contact two days later but it was clear at this point that Yutu was no longer capable of moving 
across the lunar surface, apparently because of a control circuit malfunction in its driving unit. Instead, mission scientists reformulated a limited mission for Yutu as a stationary science platform. 
Total traverse distance was computed as 0.114 
kilometers. Because the problem on the rover was in a unit that also controlled the mobility of the 
solar panels to face the Sun, controllers expected the rover to lose power, but the rover appears to 
have communicated with mission control through at least early September 2014. The lander mean-while entered a ﬁmaintenance modeﬂ at some point in mid-2014 but continued operating through the year. In January 2015, over a year after landing, the 
Chinese media announced that the lander was still returning data, having entered its 14th lunar night, thus making it the longest functioning spacecraft on the lunar surface. The lander was said to be in contact at least once a month well into fall 2016 and sending back scientific data from at least one instrument, its ultraviolet telescope. The Chinese also released entire datasets of imagery from both the lander and the rover in January 2016. As far as 
Yutu, in March 2015, Ye Peijian confirmed that the 
rover was immobile but still working. The rover was still maintaining communications to at least July 2016 but the following month, Yutu was officially 
declared dead after operating for 31 months. At 
least one instrument on the lander (the ultraviolet telescope) was still active as of June 2018.236GaiaNation: ESA (8)

Results: Gaia is a European space observatory whose goal is to chart a three-dimensional map of the Milky Way galaxy in order to reveal the composi
-tion, formation, and evolution of the galaxy. More 
specifically, Gaia provides high-quality positional 
and radial velocity measurements to produce a ste-reoscopic and kinematic census of about one bil-lion stars in our galaxy (about 1% of the total) and the Local Group. Launched by a Russian Soyuz, the Fregat upper stage pushed Gaia into a 175 × 
175-kilometer Earth orbit, and then fired again for a long burn into a 344 × 962,690-kilometer orbit at 
15.0° inclination. It performed a mid-course cor-rection the day after launch. On 8 January 2014, 
Gaia entered its operational orbit around the SunŒEarth L2, about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, when its engine fired to boost the spacecraft into a 263,000 × 707,000-kilometer halo orbit around L2 with a period of 180 days. After four further 
months of calibration, alignment, and proper 
focusing of the telescopes on board, Gaia began its five-year mission on 25 July 2014 to produce the 2952013
 most accurate 3D map of the Milky Way galaxy. 
In its observation mode, Gaia spins slowly (once 

every 6 hours), sweeping its two telescopes across 
the entire sky and focusing the received light 
simultaneously onto a single digital camera, the 

largest flown in space, with nearly a billion pixels 

(106 CCDs each with 4,500 × 1,996 pixels). It 
will observe each of its billion stars an average 
of 70 times over five years. In September 2014, 

ESA announced that Gaia had discovered its first 

supernova, Gaia14aaa, some 500 million light-years away from Earth. A minor anomaly, ﬁa stray 
light problemﬂ was detected shortly after launch 

that might degrade the quality of some of the 

results, especially for the faintest stars, but ESA 
scientists are confident that mitigation schemes 
will compensate for the problem. In August 2015, 

Gaia completed its first year of science observa-tions, during which it had recorded 272 billion 
positional or astrometric measurements, 54.4 

billion photometric data points, and 5.4 billion 

spectra. On 6 November 2015, the spacecraft 
was placed perfectly to see a lunar transit across 
the Sun, viewed from Gaia™s vantage point as a 

small, dark circle crossing the face of the Sun. On 

14˜September 2016, ESA released its first dataset 
from Gaia that included positions and G magni-tudes for about one billion stars based on obser-vations from 25 July 2014 to 16 September 2015. 
A second data release is planned for April 2018 
and will include positions, parallaxes, and proper 
motions for approximately one billion stars. Final 

Gaia results in the form of complete datasets are 

not expected to be publicly available until the early 
2020s. Besides its primary goal of mapping stars, 
Gaia also carries out observations of known aster-oids within our solar system, providing data on the 

orbits and physical properties of these bodies.An artist™s rendering of ESA™s Gaia astrometry spacecraft.

Launch Site: Xichang
Scientific Instruments:1. cameras2. biological payloadsResults: This mission, called Chang™e 5 Flight Test 
Device (or CE 5-T1), was a precursor to the planned 
Chang™e 5 mission, which, at the time of writing, is slated to land on the Moon and return lunar sam-ples (at least 2 kilograms) back to Earth in 2019. The spacecraft consists of a bus (DFH-3A) simi-lar to the CE-1 and CE-2 lunar orbiters, but with a large decent vehicle, resembling a scaled-down version of the piloted Shen Zhou descent module. 
During this flight, the reentry module carried a 
complement of biological payloads. The goal of the 
test mission was to fly a full-scale circumlunar mis-sion so as to flight-test the reentry vehicleŠpar-ticularly the heatshieldŠin real conditions before 
the actual sample return mission. This was the first circumlunar mission and recovery of a spacecraft since the Soviet Zond 8 mission in 1970. The pay-load entered into a parking orbit around Earth after 
successful firing of the launch vehicle™s first three 
stages. The third stage then reignited for about 3 
minutes to send the payload on a translunar tra-jectory of 209 × 413,000 kilometers. Soon after TLI, the spacecraft deployed its solar arrays and 
implemented at least two mid-course corrections (on 24 and 25 October). Chang™e 5-T1 entered the Moon™s gravitational influence at 13:30 UT, 

before flying around the far side of the Moon, 
with the closest distance of approximately 12,000 kilometers reached at 19:03 UT on 27 October. 
Throughout its voyage to the Moon, the spacecraft 
relayed back spectacular pictures of both Earth 
and the Moon. On the four-day trip home, the 
spacecraft performed one mid-course correction. Before entry into Earth™s atmosphere, at 21:53 UT 

on 31˜October, the headlight-shaped descent vehi
-cle separated from the service module when about 5,000 kilometers from Earth; 5 minutes later, the 
service module fired its engine (for about 12 min-utes) to go back into a translunar orbit. The descent 
vehicle, meanwhile, completed a ﬁdouble-dipﬂ 
reentry into Earth™s atmosphere to reduce g-loads.

The second time it entered Earth™s atmosphere, 
it deployed its parachute system at 10 kilometers 
altitude and safely touched down at 22:42 UT in 
China™s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The 
descent vehicle was located just 5 minutes after touchdown. Yang Mengfeil, the ﬁcommanderﬂ 
of the lunar exploration program at CASC noted 
that ﬁ[f]rom what we have seen, the capsule is in good condition
 – and will lay a solid foundation 
for our future space program.ﬂ Meanwhile, the ser-vice module of CE 5-T1 circled back into a high Earth orbit (540,000 × 600 kilometers) that slung it back towards the Moon, which it passed by on 23 November after two mid-course corrections. On 23 November, after reaching perilune and with the 
help of gravity assist from the Moon, the spacecraft headed to the EarthŒMoon L2 Lagrange Point 
where it arrived on 27 November and entered into a 
Lissajous-type orbit at 20,000 × 40,000 kilometers 
with a period of 14 days. A little over a month later, 
at 15:00 UT on 4 January 2015, the service module left L2 after three circuits around it, and headed back toward the Moon. Six days later, at around 
19:00 UT, the spacecraft returned back into lunar 
orbit with initial parameters of 200 × 5,300 kilo-meters with a period of 8 hours. Over the following two days, CE 5-T1 made three orbital corrections, ending up, by 11 January, in a 200-kilometer orbit. 
Once at the Moon, the spacecraft conducted two 
ﬁvirtual targetﬂ rendezvous tests in February and 
March 2015 to rehearse for the future CE-5 mis
-sion. Later, between 30 August and 2 September 
2015, CE 5-T1 carried out an intensive photogra-phy mission, some of it at altitudes as low as 30 kilo-meters. The campaign was dedicated to identifying potential landing sites for the Chang™e 5 sample 
return mission. By 1 March 2016, the spacecraft had completed over 4,100 orbits around the Moon. The Chinese launch vehicle™s upper stage carried 
a secondary payload called the Manfred Memorial 
Moon Mission (LX0OHB-4M or 4M) prepared by the Germany company OHB System and managed by LuxSpace. The experiment, in honor of its OHB founder Manfred Fuchs (1938Œ2014) weighed 14 kilograms and contained two instruments, a radio beacon and a radiation dosimeter (provided by the Spanish company iC-Málaga).

Results: Hayabusa 2 is a Japanese spacecraft on a six-year mission to rendezvous and land on a C-class asteroid, (162173) 199 JU3, dispatch a series of landers and a penetrator, collect samples 
from it, and then return to Earth. The probe is an evolutionary follow-on to the Hayabusa (1) mis-sion, launched in 2003, which had similar goals. The new mission is designed to be ﬁmore reliable and robustﬂ and has several improved systems from its predecessor. Hayabusa 2™s flight profile involves 
an Earth gravity-assist flyby in December 2015 before a rendezvous with its target asteroid in July 2018. At the asteroid, Hayabusa 2 will deploy a 
2992014
 target marker (somewhat like a little beanbag filled with granular particles) to establish an artificial 

landmark, and then land on the planetary body. 
Five of these target markers are carried aboard the spacecraft, as opposed to three on its prede-cessor. As it touches the surface multiple times, 

Hayabusa˜2 will activate its SMP sampler mecha
-nism which will release a small projectile to be shot 
into the ground so material is ejected that is col-lected by a ﬁcatcher.ﬂ Additionally, Hayabusa 2 will 

deploy several passenger payloads, including the 
10-kilogram MASCOT (Mobile Asteroid Surface 
Scout), a joint French-German lander that is capa
-ble of lifting off the asteroid and landing again to 
sample different areas with its suite of instruments. Hayabusa 2 will also carry the SCI (Small Carry-on Impactor), a small explosive penetrator that will 
use a 2-kilogram pure copper ﬁlumpﬂ (or a ﬁlinerﬂ) 
30 centimeters in diameter that will be dropped to the surface of the asteroid at a velocity of 2 kilo-meters/second to make an artificial crater. A palm-
size deployable camera (DCAM3) will observe 

the explosive impact of the SCI while the mother 
ship is positioned on the opposite side of the aster-oid during the impact to protect it. Hayabusa 2 
also carries three 1-kilogram rovers installed on 
MINERVA-II1 (which has Rover1A and Rover1B) 

and MINERVA-II2 (which has Rover2). They will 
take pictures and collect temperature data at var
-ious points. Once its mission is over, Hayabusa 2 
will leave orbit around the asteroid in December 2019 and return to Earth a year later, in December 

2020, for a reentry and recovery of the samples collected. After a successful launch, Hayabusa 2 
and its fellow travelers left the EarthŒMoon sys
-tem on 6 December 2014, entering heliocentric 
orbit at 0.915 × 1.089 AU at 6.8° inclination to the 
ecliptic. It completed an initial period of checkout by 2 March 2015 and then began to move into its 

ﬁcruising phaseﬂ while heading to asteroid 1999 
JU3. Less than a year later, on 3 December 2015, 
Hayabusa 2 carried out an Earth flyby at a range of 3,090 kilometers over the Hawaiian islands. The 
encounter increased the spacecraft™s velocity by 

about 1.6 kilometers/second to about 31.9 kilome-ters/second (relative to the Sun). The spacecraft, 
remaining in good health, performed its first major 
firing of its ion engines from 22 March to 5 May 
2016, followed by a shorter (3.5 hour) firing on 20˜May to adjust its trajectory.

JU3 (later renamed 162173 Ryugu). Launched at the same time as the Hayabusa 2 mission, PROCYON is accompanying the larger spacecraft to its own asteroid target, designated (185851) 2000 DP107 (an asteroid that has its own moon). The plan for the mission was that it would pass within 50 kilometers of the target at a relative flyby velocity of 10 kilometers/second. The spacecraft, largely built from commercial off-the-shelf equip-ment is equipped with a micro-propulsion sys-tem named I-COUPS (Ion thruster and Cold-gas thruster developed for PROCYON) that uses ion engines and multiple cold gas thrusters fed from 
the same tank (containing 2.5 kilograms xenon at 
launch). After launch with Hayabusa 2 (see entry 
for that mission) into low Earth parking orbit, the H-IIA rocket™s second stage fired again for 4 min
-utes, 1 second to accelerate the entire payload (Hayabusa 2, PROCYON, and ArtSat-2) into helio
-centric orbit. While Hayabusa separated from the upper stage 3 minutes, 40 seconds after the burn was complete, PROCYON separated 15 minutes after Hayabusa and, like its compatriots, entered heliocentric orbit. University of Tokyo and JAXA 
announced that they had received the first signals from PROCYON at 00:51 UT on 3 December and that it was on its confirmed interplanetary trajec-tory. By 10 March 2015, the on-board ion engine 
had operated for 223 hours but then stopped func-tioning apparently due to a high voltage problem, thus potentially threatening both the planned Earth flyby on 3 December 2015 and the asteroid 
flyby on 12 May 2016. When it was clear that the engine could no longer be restarted, in May 2015, the asteroid flyby was abandoned. In the event, PROCYON flew past Earth on 3 December at a 
range of 2.7 million kilometers. Despite the loss of the asteroid flyby, PROCYON used its telescopic 
imager to return photos of Earth and the EarthŒMoon system during its Earth flyby.

Launch Site: Tanegashima / Area Y1
Scientific Instruments:1. dosimeterResults: Shin™en 2 is a small satellite amateur radio payloadŠalso given the Oscar designation of Fuji- Oscar 82Šthat carried a radio operating in the amateur UHF and VHF bands. During its mission, 
it was to simply downlink basic telemetry param-eters (voltage, current, temperature, etc.) as well 
as data from the NASA-supplied radiation dosim-eter. Radio enthusiasts could also uplink messages 
to the satellite. Once the satellite and its sister payloads were sent out to heliocentric orbit after launch, Shin™en 2 separated from the H-IIA second stage at 06:16 UT about 6 minutes, 40 seconds 
after the separation of Hayabusa 2. Contact with 
Shin™en 2 was established soon after, although the 
last reported transmission was on 14 December from 20:13 UT to 23:00 UT when the spacecraft 
was between 4.67 and 4.72 million kilometers from Earth. Like its sister spacecraft, Shin™en 2 flew by Earth on 4 December at 10:27 UT, at a range of 
about 5.71 million kilometers. Attempts to detect 
signals from Shin™en 2 at the time proved to be unsuccessful.301

Scientific Instruments: [none]
Results: DESPATCH (Deep Space Amateur 
Troubadour™s Challenge) or ArtSat-2 was a proj
-ect developed at Tama Art University to build a 
3D-printed sculpture and launch it into deep space. The sculpture, measuring 50 × 50 × 45 centime-ters, contained a 7-watt CW radio transmitter that 
operated in an amateur UHF frequency (437.325 
MHz) and transmitted automatically generated ﬁpoeticﬂ messages (in English) from space using 
telemetry numbers derived from voltage and tem-
perature readings on board. As a whole, the project 
was designed to combine art and technology into a singular whole, to create a ﬁdeep-space sculp-tureﬂ while also producing ﬁgenerative poetry.ﬂ The 

on-board batteries were designed to work for only seven days until the spacecraft was about 3 million kilometers from Earth. After launch and insertion 

into heliocentric orbit, it separated from the H-IIA upper stage around 06:21 UT on 3 December 2014. ArtSat personnel received transmissions of 
its ﬁcosmic poemﬂ after launch, but the poem was 
transmitted at irregular intervals. By 14 December, 

ArtSat-2 was already 4.7 million kilometers from Earth and in a 0.7 × 1.3 AU orbit and still transmit
-ting. On 3 January 2015, the Tama Art University 
team concluded attempts to receive further trans-missions from ArtSat-2 since the on-board battery 
had a lifetime of 27 days after launch. Despite its death, it has fully achieved its goal of being ﬁthe 
most distant artwork in the world.ﬂ Like its sister 
spacecraft, Hayabusa-2, PROCYON, and Shin™en 
2, DESPATCH performed an Earth flyby on 
4˜December at a range of 5.8 million kilometers. 

DESPATCH was also known as Fuji-Oscar 81.

Results: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) is a joint mission between NASA, NOAA, and the USAF designed as a successor NASA™s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), 
whose goal is to provide real-time solar wind obser-vations from an L1 orbit. The roots of the project date back to Triana, originally conceived in 1998 by 
then-Vice President Albert A. Gore, Jr. (1948Œ˜), as 
a NASA Earth science mission to provide a (near) continuous view of Earth from space (and also use 
a radiometer to take direct measurements of sun-light reflected and emitted from Earth). Despite being originally slated for launch on STS-107 
(the tragic mission of Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003), Triana was canceled in 2001 and the sat
-ellite put into storage. Seven years later, in 2008, 
the Committee on Space Environmental Sensor Mitigation Options (CSESMO) determined that using that spacecraft would be ﬁthe optimal solution for meeting NOAA and USAF space weather requirements.ﬂ The satellite was removed from storage in November 2008 and recertified for launch with some modifications. The satel-lite, designed on the basis of the Small Explorer Program (SMEX-Lite) bus, was launched into an initial orbit of 184 × 186 kilometers at 37° incli-nation. About 30 minutes following launch, Falcon 
9™s second stage re-ignited to boost DSCOVR into 
a 187 × 1,371,156-kilometer transfer orbit at 37° inclination. By 24 February, the spacecraft had 
reached the halfway mark to the L1 position, trav-eling nearly 0.8 million kilometers. By 8 June, 100 days after launch, DSCOVR finally reached the SunŒEarth L1 point, and entered a Lissajous orbit, about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, where it has a continuous view of the Sun and the sunlit side of Earth. Its primary mission is to provide a suite of diverse data on variations in the solar wind, pro-vide early warning on coronal mass ejections, and observe Earth climate changes in ozone, aerosols, dust and volcanic ash, cloud altitudes, and vegeta-tion cover. DSCOVR also takes full Earth pictures 
about every 2 hours, returning its first views of the entire sunlit side of Earth from approximately 1.6 million kilometers (using the EPIC instrument). In October 2015, NASA launched a Web site that 
posted at least a dozen new color images every day from EPIC. Earlier, on 16Œ17 July, the spacecraft 
took striking images of the Moon moving over the Pacific Ocean near North America. Similar pic
-tures, showing the farside of the Moon had been taken by Deep Impact in May 2008 but from a much further distance of 50 million kilometers. 
On 28 October 2015, NASA officially handed over control of DSCOVR to NOAA (more specifically, 
its Space Weather Prediction Center, SWPC) 
304BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
for the latter agency to begin optimizing the final settings for its space weather instruments. The 
spacecraft completed its first year in deep space on 11˜February 2016, now serving as the U.S.™s pri
-mary warning system for solar magnetic storms and solar wind data. Real-time data from DSCOVR and space weather forecasts were available to the gen-eral public beginning July 2016 from the SWPC Web site; the center also began coordinating the 
work of DSCOVR with GOES-16 which was 
launched on 19 November 2016.243LISA Pathfinder
Nation: ESA (9)
Objective(s): SunŒEarth L1 Lagrange Point
Spacecraft: SMART-2
Spacecraft Mass: 1,910 kg
Mission Design and Management: ESA
Launch Vehicle:
 Vega (no. VV06)
Launch Date and Time:
 3 December 2015 / 04:04:00 UT
Launch Site: Kourou / ELV
Scientific Instruments:1. LISA Technology Package (LTP)
2. Disturbance Reduction System (DRS)Results: LISA Pathfinder is a technology demon
-strator for future spaceborne gravitational wave 
detectors, such as the proposed Evolved Laser 
Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA), tentatively 
planned for 2034. The spacecraft is equipped to 
test one of the key concepts behind gravitational 
wave detectors, that free particles follow geodesics 
in space-time. It does this by tracking the rela-tive motions of two test masses in nearly perfect 
gravitational free fall, using picometer resolution 
laser interferometry. The name ﬁLISAﬂ comes from 
ﬁLaser Interferometer Space Antenna,ﬂ an earlier 
abandoned concept for an observatory to study 
gravitational waves. The spacecraft has a main sci-ence spacecraft and a separable propulsion mod-ule, the latter used for raising LISA Pathfinder™s 
orbit after launch and sending it to its operational 
Lissajous orbit around the SunŒEarth L1 Lagrange 
Point. The science spacecraft carries two test 
packages. The first, LTP, contains two identical 
test masses (Gravitational Reference Sensors), 
each weighing 2 kilograms in the form of 46-mm 
gold-platinum cubes suspended in its own vac-uum container. Contributors include teams from 
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, 
Switzerland, and the UK. The second, DRS, is a 
NASA-built system, originally from the canceled 
Space Technology 7 mission, made up of two clus
-ters of colloidal micro-propulsion thrusters and 
a computer. LISA Pathfinder was launched into 
an initial orbit of 208 × 1,165 kilometers. Vega™s 
liquid propellant fourth stage (known as AVUM) 
then refired to put the spacecraft into a 209 × 
1,521-kilometer orbit at 6.0° inclination. The 
propulsion module then slowly fired six times, 
thus raising LISA Pathfinder™s apogee until it 
began a cruise to L1. After a six-week trip and a 
final 64-second firing, the spacecraft arrived in a 
Lissajous orbit around L1 on 22 January 2016. At 
11:30 UT, the propulsion module separated from 
the science section. Its final orbit was a roughly 
500,000 × 800,000-kilometer orbit around L1. 
About two weeks later, on 3 February, ESA con
-trollers at the European Space Operations Center 
(ESOC) at Darmstadt, Germany, retracted eight 
locking ﬁfingersﬂ pressing on the two gold-platinum 
cubes, at the time held in position by two rods. 
These rods were retracted from the first test mass 
on 15 February, and from the second the following 
day. Finally, on 22 February, controllers set the two 
cubes completely free to move under the effect of 
gravity alone, with actively maneuvering spacecraft 
around them. In the subsequent few months, the 
LISA Pathfinder team applied a number of differ
-ent forces to the cubes to study their reaction. For 
example, one experiment involved raising the tem-perature of the housing, thus heating the very few gas molecules remaining in there to measure the effect on the cubes. After several months of suc
-cessful experiments, at 08:00 UT on 25 June 2016, 3052015
 the LTP completed its ﬁnominal operations phase,ﬂ 
thus transitioning to work on NASA™s DRS exper
-iment. Almost simultaneously, on 21Œ22 June, 
ESA approved a mission extension, beginning 
1˜November, for seven months, during which inves
-tigators will be working with LTP. The mission was 
finally concluded on 30˜June 2017. Earlier, in June 

2016, mission scientists published the first results 

of the LISA Pathfinder experiments, confirming 
that the two cubes were falling freely under the influence of gravity alone, to a precision level more 
than five times better than originally expected.LISA Path˜nder operates from a vantage point in space about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth towards the Sun, orbiting

4. Combined Aerothermal Sensor Package 
(COMARS+)5. Instrument for Landing Œ Roving Laser Retroreflector Investigations (INRRI)Results: The first in a series of joint missions under the ExoMars program between ESA and 
Roskosmos, the Russian space agency, the ExoMars 
Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is designed to study 
methane and other atmospheric trace gases pres
-ent in small concentrations in the Martian atmo
-sphere. Despite their relative scarcity (less than 1% of the atmosphere), studying these gases could pro-vide evidence for possible biological or geological activity. Organisms on Earth release methane when 
they digest nutrients, although geological processes 
(such as the oxidation of certain minerals) can also release methane. ExoMars TGO was originally a 
collaborative project with NASA but the latter™s 
contribution was cut due to lack of support in 2012, leading to cooperation with the Russians. As 
currently envisioned, the two ExoMars missions 
involve the TGO and Schiaparelli (first mission) and a lander-rover (second mission) in 2020, both 
launched by the Russians, who also are contribut-ing hardware to both missions. Besides its primary mission, ExoMars TGO also had two secondary missions: to deliver the Schiaparelli Entry, Descent, 
and Landing Demonstrator Module (EDM), an Italian-built lander designed to test technologies planned for use in future soft-landings on Mars; and to serve as a data relay to support communica-tions for the ExoMars 2020 rover and surface sci-ence platform. The orbiter included instruments developed by Belgium (NOMAD), Russia (ACS 
and FREND), and Switzerland (CaSSIS). EDM™s 
scientific mission was limited to measurements of several atmospheric parameters (such as wind 
speed and direction, humidity, pressure, etc.). Its 
small technical camera, weighing 0.6 kilograms, 
was a refurbished spare flight model of the Visual 
Monitoring Camera flown on ESA™s Herschel and 
308BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
Planck spacecraft. Teams from Italy, France, the 
Netherlands, Finland, Spain, and Belgium con
-tributed to EDM. The Russian Proton-M + Briz-M combination inserted the payload stack into an ini
-tial 185 × 185-kilometer orbit at 51.5° inclination. A second Briz-M firing after one orbit raised the orbit to 250 × 5,800 kilometers, and a third burn raised it further to 696 × 21,086 kilometers. A final 
fourth firing sent the payload to escape velocity with spacecraft release from Briz-M occurring at 20:13˜UT on the day of the launch. On 14 March 
2016, ExoMars adjusted its trajectory with a 52-minute burn. Finally, on 19 October, TGO fired 
its engine for 139 minutes from 13:05 to 15:24 
UT to enter its planned initial orbit around Mars of 346 × 95,228 kilometers at 9.7° inclination. Three days earlier, at 14:42 UT on 16 October, 
the orbiter had released the EDM that was pro-grammed to autonomously perform an automated 
landing sequence. After it entered the atmosphere 
at 14:42 UT on 19 October, the sequence would 
include parachute deployment, front heat shield release (at between 11 and 7 kilometers altitude), retrorocket braking (starting at 1,100 meters alti-tude), and a final freefall from a height of 2 meters, cushioned by a crushable structure. During this phase, Schiaparelli was to have captured 15 images of the approaching surface. Unfortunately, the sig
-nal from the lander was lost a short time before the planned landing sequence initiated. Later analysis showed that the parachute deployed normally at an 
altitude of 12 kilometers and the heatshield was released as planned at 7.8 kilometers. However, at 
some point, an inertial measurement unit sent an incorrect reading of the vehicle™s rotation, which in 
turn generated an incorrect estimated altitude (in fact, a negative altitude) which triggered prema
-ture release of the parachute and backshell, firing of the thrusters and activation of ground systems even though the lander was still at an altitude of 3.7 kilometers. As such, the Schiaparelli simply 
plummeted from that altitude to the ground at near terminal velocity and was destroyed. During atmospheric entry, some data was collected by the 
COMARS+ instrument. The day after the crash, NASA™s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) 
photographed the crash site in Meridiani Planum. Higher resolution images taken on 25 October 
and 1 November (the latter in color) showed more detail. Impact coordinates were 6.11° W / 2.07° S. The orbiter, meanwhile, began several months of 
aerobraking to reach its nominal 400-kilometer cir-cular orbit for its primary science mission slated to begin in late 2017. In November 2016, TGO was in a highly elliptical 230 Œ310 × 98,0000-kilometer orbit with an orbital period of 4.2 days. Between 20 and 28 November, it tested and calibrated its 
four scientific instruments for the first time. In January 2017, the orbiter carried out three maneu
-vers by firing its main engine to adjust inclination to 74°, necessary for its primary science mission to begin later in the year. By March 2017, TGO 
was in a one-day 200 × 33,000-kilometer orbit and 
was using the atmosphere to adjust the orbit by a 
process of gradual aerobraking. The goal was to 
achieve a final operational circular orbit at 400 kilo-meters by March 2018 at which time full-scale sci-ence operations would begin. Earlier, in December 
2016, ESA announced the formal approval of the 
second joint European-Russian ExoMars mission, 
tentatively slated for launch in 2020.245OSIRIS-RExNation: USA (101)

Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission is the third major 
planetary science mission falling under NASA™s 
New Frontiers Program (after New Horizons 

launched in 2006 and Juno launched in 2011). 

The goal of the mission is to reach a near-Earth 
asteroid 101955 Bennu (formerly known as 1999 
RQ36), collect a 59.5-gram sample, and then 

return it to Earth. The science mission, developed 

by scientists at the University of Arizona, will open 
up the possibilities to glean more information on 

how planets formed and how life began and help 
scientists understand asteroids that could impact 
Earth in the future. About 55 minutes after launch, 

after a boost by the Centaur upper stage, OSIRIS-
REx separated from the Atlas V and the solar 
arrays deployed. At 17:30˜UT, on 9 September, the 
spacecraft crossed the orbital path of the Moon at 

a range of 386,500 kilometers. Three days later, 

it was in heliocentric orbit at 0.77 × 1.17 AU. 
Beginning 19˜September, the mission team acti
-vated all of its scientific instruments. The larger 
Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM) thrust
-
ers were fired (for 12 seconds) for the first time 

on 7 October for a mid-course correction. The 
spacecraft also carries three other sets of thrust-ersŠthe Attitude Control System (ACS), a Main 

Engine (ME), and Low Thrust Reaction Engine 

Assembly (LTR) thrustersŠthus providing signifi
-cant redundancy for maneuvers. On 28˜December 

2016, the spacecraft conducted its first Deep 

Space Maneuver (DSM-1), firing the main engine 

to position it properly for an Earth gravity-assist 
310
BEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958Œ2016
encounter in late 2017. A second firing, the first 
to use the spacecraft™s Attitude Control System 
(ACS) thrusters, on 25˜August 2017, further 
sharpened its trajectory by changing the velocity 
by 47.9 centimeters/second. About a month later, 
on 22 September, OSIRIS-REx passed over Earth 
at a range of 17,237 kilometers as part of a grav-ity-assist maneuver that tilted its orbit to match 
Bennu. During the encounter, the spacecraft took 
several high-resolution pictures of both Earth 
and the Moon. The actual asteroid encounter is 
scheduled to begin in August 2018, culminating 
in a rendezvous with Bennu. OSIRIS-REx will 
survey the asteroid for about a year beginning 
October 2018 and select a final touchdown site. 
The actual sample collection will be carried out 
by the TAGSAM instrument which will release 
a burst of nitrogen gas to blow regolith particles 
into a sampler head at the end of a robotic arm. 
The spacecraft is capable of returning to the aster-oid in case of a first failed attempt at sample col-lection. In March 2021, there will be a window 
to depart from Bennu, allowing OSIRIS-REx to 
begin its Earthward return trip. If all goes well, the 
spacecraft will return to Earth in September 2023, 
when the sample return capsule will separate from 
the main spacecraft and enter Earth™s atmosphere, 
landing at the Utah Test and Training Range.
