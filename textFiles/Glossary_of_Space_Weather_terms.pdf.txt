Glossary of Space Weather related terms
  ambient solar wind
 the undisturbed outflow of the Sun's ionized atmosphere into interplanetary 
space
  ACE
 the
 Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft is positioned on the 
Earth
-Sun line and provides measurements of the solar wind plasma and 
radiation conditions that will impact Earth.
  active regions
 A disturbed volume of the Sun's atmosphere that often co
nsists of (from 
bottom to top) sunspots, plage, prominences, and hot magnetized loops. 
Active regions may release significant amounts of energy during magnetic 
eruptions that produce coronal mass ejections and/or flares.
  ambient solar wind
 the outflow of 
the Sun's ionized atmosphere into interplanetary space
  AU 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) is equal to the average distance from the Earth to 
the Sun. This is a convenient measure of distances in the solar system.
  aurora
 transient displays of light, often displa
ying as moving curtains and rays, at 
high latitudes associated with geomagnetic disturbances
  auroral region
 oval
-shaped, high
-latitude zone centered on the geomagnetic pole, in 
which aurora are most visible. 
  auroral activity
 usually refers to visible au
rora and the particles that create them, but may 
also refer to electrical currents that flow in the auroral region. One measure 
of auroral activity is hemispheric power
  auroral boundary
 The high and low latitude edges of the auroral
 zone, typically 72 deg 
(poleward) and 62 deg (equatorward)
