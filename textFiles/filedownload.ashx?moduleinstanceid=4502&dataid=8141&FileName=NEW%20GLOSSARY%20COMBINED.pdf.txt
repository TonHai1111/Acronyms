BIOLOGY GLOSSARY 
A 
Abiotic (factor) 
  A term that describes a nonliving factor in an ecosystem 
Absolute Dating  
Based
 on the amount of carbon-14 or other radioactive elements 
that remains in a fossil; gives the fossil an approximate age in years 
Accessory Pigment 
  Light-absorbing compounds found in photosynthetic organisms 
that work with chlorophyll 
a; these include chlorophyll 
b, c, and 
d, carotenoids, and 
phycobiliproteins, all of these absorb and transfer light energy to photosystem 
chlorophyl
l   Acid  
Solution with a pH lower than 7. 
Acid Rain  
Rain 
or any other form of
 precipitation
 that is unusually 
acidic
, meaning 
that it possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low 
pH, caused by emissions 
of sulfur dioxide
 and nitrogen oxide
, which react with the 
water
 molecules in th
e atmosphere to produce acids),harmful effects to plants, aquatic animals and 
infrastructure. Acid rain is  
   Activation Energy  
Energy needed to get a reaction started. 
Active Transport 
  The movement of particles from an area of low concentration to an 
area of high concentration that uses energy provided by ATP or a difference in 

electrical charges across a cell membrane. 
Adaptation
   
 Adaptive Radiation  
Process in which organisms 
diversify rapidly into a multitude of 
new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources 
available, creates new challenges and opens environmental niches
 Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) 
A molecule that provides energy for cellular 
reactions and processes. ATP releases energy when one of its high
energy bonds is 
broken to release a phosphate group. 
Adhesion  
The intermolecular attraction between unlike molecules. Capillary action 
results from the adhesive properties of water and the molecules that make up plant 

cells. 
Aerobic Respiration 
  Type of cellular respiration that requires oxygen. 
Agriculture 
  The artificial cultivation of food, fiber, and other goods by the systematic 
growing and harvesting of various organisms. 
Air Pollution
  Particulates
, 
biological molecules
, or other harmful materials introduced 
into the 
Earth's atmosphere
, possibly causing disease, death to humans, damage to 
other living organisms such as food crops, or the 
natural
 or built environment
 Alcoholic Fermentation 
Type of anaerobic respiration that includes glycolysis 
followed by the conversion of pyruvic acid to ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide and the 
formation of NAD
+
