Purpose
The USGS Thesaurus provides a controlled vocabulary of scientific concepts relevant to the mission and work of the USGS. This controlled vocabulary helps to categorize USGS information and allows people and computers to find collections of information resources that have common characteristics.
Content
The USGS Thesaurus is structured as a hierarchy of terms because relationships between concepts are represented.
For example, Sciences is broad and general concept. A more specific type of Sciences is Earth Sciences. In the USGS Thesaurus, Sciences is a broader or parent term to Earth Sciences.
The USGS Thesaurus has the following top-level categories that are used to group scientific concepts.
Sciences
Major educational fields, fields of study, and professional groupings within USGS.
Methods
Techniques, methods, procedures, or strategies for research, management, collection, or analysis of scientific information in USGS.
Topics
Themes, subjects, and concerns for which USGS information resources are relevant.
Product types
General representation of the information in a resource, such as a map or dataset.
Time periods
Geologic time periods and seasons of the year.
Institutional structures and activities
Activities, processes, and organizational concepts.

The thesaurus is limited in depth and specificity of coverage. It does not
attempt to replicate existing controlled vocabularies such as AGI's GeoRef.
The intention is to provide sufficient contextual cues for the information
seeker to determine the relevance of a resource for his or her concern, not
to locate precisely the answer to a specific user question.
History
Science Topics, a component of the USGS home page from 2005 to 2015,
was a browsable index of web resources intended for the public.
It
augmented traditional search and site-specific browse interfaces in
concert with a "USGS by State" and "About USGS" sites, and was
specifically intended to work alongside those facilities.
This infrastructure was specifically intended to help people outside
USGS find information on USGS web sites without specific knowledge of
the organizational structure and operations of the USGS.
The interface
design was based on the idea that finding information cannot be
separated from understanding, so in the process of browsing or
searching a user is assisted by seeing relationships among scientific
concepts, and learns while searching.
Underpinning this interface were several controlled vocabularies
structured as formal thesauri and authority lists, a catalog of web
resources appropriate for the intended audience, and software used to
create, review, and modify both the controlled vocabularies and the
catalog records.
The system served as an example of the reapplication
of classic library methodologies in the web setting.
Each information resource in the Science Topics catalog was categorized
using several index terms.
Consequently a document would be listed
under each category for which it would be considered a relevant
resource.
Approximately 2000 web resources were listed in the catalog.
