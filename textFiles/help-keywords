Astrobiology Keywords
As part of the
Astrobiology Resource Metadata Standard (ARMS), we have developed
a set of astrobiology keywords to characterize the content
of Astrobiology Resource, such as datasets and research papers.
The ARMS set of keywords is a compilation of publication-style
keywords extracted from Astrobiology related journals over the past 10 years
1. After careful curation of the keywords,
we developed a 4 tier taxonomy with over 750 taggable keywords.
To help users find and select
keywords, they are organized hierarchically, under a top-level structure
of 11 categories:
Astronomical
Biological
Chemical
Computational
Environmental
Exploration
Geological
Institutional
Methods
Planetary
Process
We validated the keywords against the abstracts of AbSciCon 2019,
and LPSC 2019, using the keywords as automatic indices.
We also performed a cluster analysis and enhanced the ARMS lexicon with a few additional keywords
present in the AbSciCon 2019 abstracts.
If you would like to browse the keywords hierarchy,

1. [Our analysis of astrobiology journal keywords includes and
augments the sets of keywords independently developed in
[Taskin and Aydinoglu 2015] and
[Miller, Gazan, and Still 2014]]
