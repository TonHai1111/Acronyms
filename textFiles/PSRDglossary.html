Glossary
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
'A'a: Blocky, angular, and rough type of lava flow.
Accretion: The growth of planetary bodies from smaller objects by impact, one impact at a time. After formation, bodies are said to have "accreted" from small objects.
Achondrite: A class of stony meteorites that crystallized from magmas. The term means without chondrules.
AGB stars: Cool, luminous, and pulsating red giant stars. Most stars in the Universe that have left the main sequence will reach their final evolutionary stage as stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB).
Agglutinates: Common particle type in lunar regolith; agglutinates consist of small rock, mineral, and glass fragments bonded together with glass—a glass that is formed by flash heating when micrometeorite impacts melt the lunar regolith. The heat can also release solar-wind-implanted hydrogen and helium from the lunar regolith, causing vesicles (bubbles) in the quickly-quenched glass. Agglutinates are typically tens of micrometers to a few millimeters in size.
Albedo: The brightness of an object or surface; it is the percentage of incoming radiation (light) that the object or surface reflects.
Amazonian Epoch: The geologic history of Mars has been divided into three broad time periods, or Epochs. From oldest to youngest, these are Noachian, Hesperian, and Amazonian (named after places on Mars). These Epochs are defined by the number of impact craters on the ground surface; older surfaces have more craters. The Amazonian Epoch extends from about 2.9-3.3 billion years ago to the present day. The actual timing of the Epochs is not known because we have different models of the rates of meteorite falls on Mars.
Amino acids: Molecules that are essential components of life as the chemical building units of proteins and enzymes. Amino acids are made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. In the context of planetary science, amino acids are found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. There are ongoing research studies of the ramifications of prebiotic chemical reactions in early Solar System environments and delivery of organic material from asteroids and comets to the early Earth.
Ammonia: A gas molecule composed of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen; NH3.
Amorphous: Lacking long-range crystalline structure; disordered.
Andesite: Dark-colored, fine-grained extrusive igneous rock with about 52 to 63 weight percent silica (SiO2). Andesite consists mainly of plagioclase and one or more mafic minerals. The word andesite is derived from the Andes Mountains, located along the western edge of South America, where andesite rock is common.
Angrite: A type of achondrite meteorite consisting of pyroxene, olivine, and plagioclase.
Angstrom: (Å), a unit of length equal to 10-8 centimeter.
Anomaly: A deviation from the common rule, type, or form; something abnormal or inconsistent.
Anorthosite:
An igneous rock made up almost entirely of plagioclase feldspar. This rock dominates the lunar highlands.
ANSMET: (The Antarctic Search for Meteorites) An exploration program to collect meteorites in Antarctica supported by grants from the Office of Polar Programs of the U. S. National Science Foundation and by NASA. The work of the ANSMET teams provides the research community with a steady source of new extraterrestrial materials, including lunar and Martian samples. [ ANSMET website ]
Antenna: A conductor by which electromagnetic waves are transmitted or received.
Antipode: A point on the surface of a sphere that is located diametrically opposite another point. For example, on the Earth the antipode of Hawaii is Botswana. The term is used commonly in lunar geology to describe locations on the Moon in relation to impact basins. Researchers have hypothesized that accumulations of converged ejecta materials, production of impact shock stresses, anomalies in lunar crustal magnetic fields, and geochemical anomalies are associated with antipodes of basins.
Aphanitic: Igneous rock texture describing grain sizes too small to see without a microscope, but rock is not glassy.
Aphelion: Point in the elliptical orbit of a comet, or asteroid, or planet about the Sun in which it is at its farthest distance from the Sun. The opposite orbital position is called perihelion.
Apollo:
U.S. Space Program that included 6 piloted lunar landings between 1969 and 1972.
Apollo astronauts collected and returned 382 kilograms of rock and sediment samples from the Moon.
Apparition: An appearance; in astronomy, the period of observation of a returning periodic comet.
Argument of perihelion: Angle along the orbit of a planet or other Solar System object as measured from the ascending node (analogous to right ascension and longitude).
Ascending node: The plane of a planet's orbit (or other Solar System object) is usually tilted with respect to the plane defined by the Solar System (the ecliptic).
These 2 great circles intersect at 2 points.
As the planet travels around its orbit, at one of the
intersection points it will pass from below the ecliptic plane to above it (i.e. northward).
This point is called the ascending node.
Asteroid: A small, mostly rocky body orbiting the Sun. Asteroids range in size from 1000 kilometers in diameter to tiny objects you could hold in your hand. Most asteroids orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter (the Asteroid belt), and are the source of most meteorites. Principal asteroids are: 1 Ceres (a dwarf planet), 2 Pallas, 3 Juno, and 4 Vesta. The majority of asteroids fall into three types: C-type (carbonaceous), S-type (silicate or stony), and M-type (metallic, nickel-iron).
Asteroid belt: The region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, from 2.1 to 3.3 AU, where most asteroids are found.
Asteroid family: Group of asteroids with similar orbital elements (distance from the Sun, inclination of the orbital plane to the Earth's orbital plane, and eccentricity of the orbit) thought to be remnants of one larger asteroid parent.
Astrobiology: Study of the origin, distribution, and destiny of life in the universe. These are interdisciplinary studies involving astronomers, astrophysicists, biologists, chemists, geneticists, geologists, paleontologists, planetary scientists, and specialists from other scientific fields. Three broad themes of astrobiology: Is there life elsewhere in the universe? How did life begin and evolve? What is the future for life on Earth and beyond?
Astronaut:
Person engaged in or trained for spaceflight.
Astronomical twilight: The time when the Sun is 12-18 degrees
below the horizon. When the Sun moves from 19 to 18 degrees below the horizon, astronomers can begin to detect an increase in the brightness of the sky, although to the naked eye the sky still looks dark.
Atmophile: (gas-loving) element. Geochemists divide elements into four basic types (based on the Goldschmidt classification). Atmophile elements remain largely in the gas phase. The other types are chalcophile, lithophile, and siderophile elements.
Atmosphere: Mixture of gases that surround and are gravitationally attached to a planet.
AU (Astronomical Unit): The mean Earth-Sun distance, equal to 149.5 million kilometers or 93 million miles.
Bacteria: Single-celled microorganisms whose cells lack a nucleus. Bacteria comprise a major domain of life called prokaryotes. In contrast, the cells in eukaryotes have a well-defined nucleus; eukarya include molds, plants, and animals. Another major domain is called archaea, microorganisms with genetic features distinct from prokarya and eukarya. Most methane-producing bacteria are actually archaea, but for simplicity many biologists informally refer to all non-eukaryotes as "bacteria."
Basalt: Fine-grained, dark-colored extrusive igneous rock with less than about 52 weight percent silica (SiO2). Because of its low silica content, basalt has a low viscosity (resistance to flow.) Basalt is composed primarily of plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene; other minerals such as olivine and ilmenite are usually present. Basalt is the most common rock on the surfaces of terrestrial planets and differentiated asteroids such as 4 Vesta. Basaltic magmas are made by the partial melting of peridotite.
Basin: See lunar basin.
Biosphere: The part of Earth's crust, water, and atmosphere where living organisms can survive.
Breccia: Consolidated, fragmental rock consisting of rock, mineral, and/or glass fragments (also called clasts) embedded in a fine-grained matrix. (See also monomict and polymict.)
CAI: Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are found in chondritic meteorites. CAIs are primitive objects that formed in the solar nebula before the planets formed. CAIs are light-colored objects rich in refractory elements (that condense at a high temperature). Besides calcium and aluminum, this includes magnesium, titanium, and rare earth elements. CAIs range in size from about a millimeter to a centimeter. Meteoriticists have identified several distinct varieties of CAIs, but all share a high temperature origin. Some might be condensates from the solar nebula. Other CAIs might be evaporation residues. See also FUN CAI.
Caldera: A large, basin-shaped volcanic depression caused by collapse after withdrawal of magma and eruption of lava.
Canonical: The generally accepted, or established, procedure or quantity.
Carbon: An element with atomic number 6; symbol: C. Graphite is a low-pressure form of carbon. Diamond is a high-pressure form of carbon. (Carbon is one of the four elements essential for life. The others are hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.)
Carbon star: A rare class of red giant stars unusually rich in carbon or carbon compounds.
Carbonaceous chondrite: Type of chondritic meteorite that is classified by bulk chemical composition (into groups such as CB, CH, CI, CK, CM, CO, CR, CV) and by the amount of aqueous alteration (into types 1 and 2) or heating without much water (types 3–6). They are chemically primitive meteorites containing water-bearing minerals and carbon compounds including a variety of organic molecules such as amino acids.
Carbonate: Common rock-forming mineral containing the carbonate ion, CO32-. Common carbonate minerals are calcite, CaCO3; siderite, FeCaCO3; magnesite, MgCO3; dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2; and ankerite, Ca(Fe,Mg,Mn)(CO3)2.
Carbon dioxide: A compound formed by combining one carbon atom with two oxygen atoms, making the molecule CO2. Carbon dioxide is an important part of the atmospheres of Venus and Mars. Carbon dioxide gas condenses to a solid below -78o C. This solid is commonly known as dry ice. The polar ice caps on Mars are made of frozen water and carbon dioxide.
Celestial body: A solid object found in space.
Celestial equator: An imaginary great circle in the sky drawn concentric to the Earth's equator.
Celestial sphere: An imaginary sphere centered on the Earth, or arbitrary large radius on the surface of which the stars are considered to be fixed.
Celsius: A temperature scale that assigns the value 0o C to the freezing point of water and the value of 100o C to the boiling point of water at standard pressure. To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: Multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32.
Ceres: The largest of the known asteroids; a dwarf planet. Also called 1 Ceres because it was the first asteroid to be discovered (by Piazzi in 1801).
Chalcophile: (ore-loving) element. Geochemists divide elements into four basic types (based on the Goldschmidt classification). Chalcophile elements follow sulfur into the sulfide minerals. The other types are lithophile, siderophile, and atmophile elements.
Chassignites: One of three types of meteorites from Mars (the SNC meteorites). Chassignites are dunites, a rock composed almost entirely of the mineral olivine. The signature stone, Chassigny, fell in France in 1815.
Chirality: In chemistry, the term describing a molecule that, due to its geometry, lacks an internal plane of symmetry and has a non-superposable mirror image. These mirror images can be designated l and d. Many amino acids are chiral. Life on Earth uses l-amino acids to make proteins.
Chondrite: An abundant class of stony meteorites with chemical compositions similar to that of the Sun and characterized by the presence of chondrules (see definition below). Chondrites come from asteroids that did not melt when formed and are designated as H, L, LL, E, or C depending on chemical compositions. The H, L, and LL types are called ordinary chondrites. The L chondrites are composed of silicate minerals (mostly olivine and pyroxene, but feldspar as well), metallic nickel-iron, and iron sulfide (called troilite). Most L chondrites are severely shocked-damaged, probably by a large impact on the asteroid in which they formed. The E type are called enstatite chondrites, a rare type that formed under very reducing conditions and are composed primarily of a magnesium silicate called enstatite. They are subdivided into the low-iron (EL) chemical group and the high-iron (HL) group. The C –carbonaceous chondrites– contain water-bearing minerals and carbon compounds including a variety of organic molecules such as amino acids. Carbonaceous chondrites are the most primitive meteorites--primitive in a chemical way. For example, the CI group of carbonaceous chondrites are closest in composition to the photosphere (visible surface) of the Sun.
Chondrule: Roughly spherical objects found in a type of meteorite called chondrites. Most chondrules are 0.5 to 2 millimeters in size and are composed of olivine and pyroxene, with smaller amounts of glass and iron-nickel metal. Two main chondrule types have been identified. Type I contain only small amounts of oxidized iron (FeO); olivine crystals in them contain only about 2 mole percent of the iron-rich-olivine fayalite (Fe2SiO4) end member. Type II chondrules contain much more FeO; olivine crystals in them typically contain 10-30 mole percent fayalite. The shapes of the mineral grains in them indicate that chondrules were once molten droplets floating freely in space.
Clementine: A global mapping mission to the Moon launched in 1994 by the U. S. Department of Defense, with science support from NASA.
Clinopyroxene: Monoclinic pyroxene mineral with a general formula of XY(Si,Al)2O6, where X can be Na+,Ca+2,Mg+2,Fe+2,Mn+2 and Y can be Mn+2, Fe+3, Mg+2, Al+3, Cr+3, Ti+4. Common clinopyroxenes include CaMgSi2O6 diopside, (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al)(Si,Al)2O6 augite, and CaFeSi2O6 hedenbergite.
Closure temperature: The temperature low enough so that there is no measureable diffusion of radioactive decay products (e.g., 40Ar) out a rock or of elements between co-existing minerals (e.g., between two minerals such as spinel and olivine). Closure temperature depends on cooling rate and diffusion rate, hence on the specific minerals, isotopes, and elements involved.
Coma: A large cloud of dust and gas which escapes from the nucleus of an active comet.
Comet: A small body (a "dirty iceball", typically 1 km across, with dust and plasma tails) that circles the Sun with a highly elliptical orbit.
Condensation: Defined in cosmochemical terms, the process that transforms a gas into a solid. For example, corundum (Al2O3) is one of the earliest solid phases predicted to condense from a gas of solar composition. In classical geochemical terms, condensation describes a phase change of a gas into a liquid. But liquids are not stable at low pressures, such as those calculated for the solar nebula as being one-thousandth to one-millionth of the atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface. At these low pressures, minerals condense at temperatures below their melting points, so they condense as solids. (For more we refer you to the textbook, Cosmochemistry by McSween ahd Huss, 2010, Cambridge University Press, chapter 7.)
Convection: Movements of mantle material, laterally or in upward-downward directions, due to heat variations.
Copernican: The geologic history of Earth's Moon has been divided into five broad time periods, or systems. From oldest to youngest, these are pre-Nectarian, Nectarian, Imbrian, Eratosthenian, and Copernican. These systems are defined by the number of impact craters on the ground surface (more craters = older surface) correlated to the absolute ages determined for the lunar rock samples returned to Earth by the U. S. Apollo missions and unpiloted Soviet Luna missions. The Copernican system extends from 1.1 billion years ago to the present day.
Core: The central region of a planet or moon frequently made of denser materials than the surrounding regions (mantle and crust).
Earth and the Moon are thought to have cores of iron and nickel.
Cosmic rays: Extremely high-energy subatomic particles that continuously bombard Earth and other planetary bodies from all directions. Most cosmic rays hit and break up atomic nuclei in Earth's upper atmosphere. Airless bodies are not protected and their surfaces (asteroids and the Moon, for example) are exposed. When cosmic rays collide with the atoms of the elements in soils and rocks on a planetary surface, the nuclei of the atoms emmit gamma rays — by measuring these gamma rays with a gamma-ray spectrometer it is possible to calculate the abundance and distribution of the chemical elements on the planet's or moon's surface.
Cosmic ray exposure age: Age based on measurements of accumulated radionuclides, in a rock or meteorite, that were produced by exposure to the cosmic rays in space. The time interval represents how long a surface on an airless body was exposed to cosmic rays or how long a meter-sized or smaller asteroid traveled in space.
Cosmochemistry: Interdisciplinary science that overlaps with geochemistry, geology, astronomy, astrophysics, and geophysics to discover the materials and fundamental processes in the solar nebula and our Solar System. These sciences give us complementary ways of looking at our origins by addressing questions like, How did the Sun and planets form? Where did we come from? Cosmochemistry, because it is a careful examination of the building blocks of the cosmos, also plays an important role in developing local resources on the Moon, Mars, and asteroids, essential to sustained human presence in space.
Crater (see Impact, Transient crater): A hole or depression. Most are roughly circular or oval in outline. On Earth most natural craters are of volcanic origin. On the Moon most are of impact origin.
Crater chain: Several craters along a general line.
Crust: The outermost layer of a planet or moon, above the mantle.
Cryptomaria (singular: cryptomare): Buried mare basalt lavas on the Moon. Many light plains in the lunar highlands have impact craters surrounded by dark piles of ejecta, nicknamed "dark-haloed craters." The dark-haloed craters formed when mare basalt lava flows were covered with ejecta from large impact craters and basins, and then small craters punctured through the ejecta to toss out mare basalt.
Dark mantle deposits: Deposits of dark glass on the Moon, possibly products of volcanic fire fountaining.
Declination: Celestial coordinate which is equivalent to the latitude of an object on Earth. This is an angular measure of how far above the celestial equator an object lies.
Density: Mass per unit volume; a measure of how much material is in a given space. Bulk density refers to the entire volume of a sample, including pore space whereas grain density is based on the solid material, excluding the pore space.
Density current: Water movement due to differences in the density of the water from place to place usually caused by changes in the amount of material held in suspension or changes in temperature or variations in salinity.
Descartes: Lunar highlands site of Apollo 16 landing on April 21, 1972.
Deuterium: An isotope of hydrogen; also called heavy hydrogen (not radioactive). Its nucleus contains a proton and a neutron; hydrogen's nucleus contains only a proton. As a reference, the measured deuterium/hydrogen ratio (D/H) in Earth's standard mean ocean water (SMOW) is 1.558x10-4. In our Solar System, the water D/H ratio is a kind of fingerprint of where icy planetesimals formed; the ratio increases with increasing formation distance from the Sun.
Differentiation: Chemical zonation caused by differences in the densities of minerals; heavy materials sink, less dense materials float. On a planetary scale, differentiation transforms an initially homogeneous body into a body with compositionally distinct core, mantle, and crust.
Diffusion: The random movement (spreading) and mass transport of molecules within a phase from regions of highest concentrations to regions of lowest concentrations.
Dissociation: The splitting apart of a molecule into its consituent atoms. For example, the splitting of carbon monoxide into carbon and oxygen or the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen when struck by ultraviolet radiation.
Diurnal: A single daily cycle.
Earthquake: Sudden motion or trembling of Earth caused by the abrupt release of slowly accumulated elastic energy in rocks.
Eccentricity: The measure of the degree of elongation of an ellipse. For example, a circle has an eccentricy of 0, and a parabola (an open figure) an eccentricity of 1. The deviation of an orbit from a perfect circle.
Ecliptic: The plane of the Solar System.
Ejecta: Material thrown out from and deposited around an impact crater.
Electromagnetic spectrum: The full range of frequencies, from radio waves to gamma rays, that characterizes light. The electromagnetic spectrum can be expressed in terms of energy, wavelength, or frequency (where the wavelength equals the speed of light divided by the frequency and energy equals Planck's constant times the frequency.)
Electron microprobe: An instrument that analyzes the chemistry of very small spots by bombarding the sample with electrons and measuring the X-rays produced. Scanning electron microscopy may be combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy.
Electron Volt: The energy given to an electron by accelerating it through 1 volt of electric potential difference.
Emission angle: In planetary photometry, the angle between an observing spacecraft and the surface normal; ranges between 0 (straight down) to 90 degrees.
Emissivity: The ratio of radiant flux (total power of electromagnetic radiation including infrared, ultraviolet, and visible per unit of area) from a body to that from a black body at the same kinetic temperature.
Energy Dispersive Analysis: Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) is an analytical technique used to determine elemental abundances in a sample. It does this by detecting the energy of X-rays emitted from a sample when bombarded with electrons. Because each element emits a characteristic X-ray energy, it is possible to determine the chemical composition of a sample.
Enstatite: MgSiO3, The magnesium-rich version of a group of minerals called pyroxenes.
Ephemeris: A table of positions in right ascension (celestial coordinate corresponding to longitude on Earth) and declination (celestial coordinate corresponding to latitude on Earth), as a function of time for a moving celestial object.
Eratosthenian: The geologic history of Earth's Moon has been divided into five broad time periods, or systems. From oldest to youngest, these are pre-Nectarian, Nectarian, Imbrian, Eratosthenian, and Copernican. These systems are defined by the number of impact craters on the ground surface (more craters = older surface) correlated to the absolute ages determined for the lunar rock samples returned to Earth by the U. S. Apollo missions and unpiloted Soviet Luna missions. The Eratosthenian system extends from 3.2 billion to 1.1 billion years ago.
Erosion: Removal of weathered rocks by moving water, wind, ice, or gravity.
Eruption: (see Source) A break out or burst of volcanic matter.
Eucrite: A common class of achondrite meteorites composed of pigeonite and plagioclase. These meteorites formed as basaltic flows on a parent body, probably asteroid 4 Vesta. (Data collected by NASA's Dawn Mission, in orbit around Vesta from 2011-2012, strengthed the association between Vesta and eucrite meteorites.)
Exoplanet: planet orbiting another star other than our Sun.
Exosphere: The uppermost region of the atmosphere of a planet or natural satellite, characterized by a density so low that molecules have only a small chance of colliding (called a collisionless gas), making them likely to escape into space.
Exsolution: The segregation, during cooling, of a homogeneous solid solution into two or more different minerals.
Extrusive: Refers to igneous rocks erupted on the surface.
Fall: A meteorite that was observed as it fell through Earth's atmosphere and was retrieved. Since most falls are collected soon after hitting the ground, these meteorites are not badly degraded or weathered.
Fahrenheit: A temperature scale with the freezing point of water assigned the value 32 oF and the boiling point of water 212 oF at standard pressure. To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius: Deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9.
Farside:
The side of the Moon that always faces away from Earth.
Fault: A fracture along which there has been movement or displacement.

Fra Mauro: Landing site of Apollo 14 on the Moon on February 5, 1971.
Fractional crystallization: Geochemical and physical processes that result in the sequential formation and separation of minerals from a melt. The residual magma changes in composition and becomes enriched in incompatible elements.
FUN CAI: A rare type of CAI. F stands for fractionation, UN stands for unidentified nuclear isotope properties. FUN CAIs are characterized by 26Al/27Al ratios much lower than the canonical value of ~5x10-5 (at the time of our Solar System's formation); they also can have large isotopic anomalies in many elements.
Fusion crust: The glassy, melted rind on a meteorite that forms when the rock passes through the Earth's atmosphere.
Gabbro: A course-grained igneous rock rich in the minerals olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar.
Galilean Moons: Jupiter's four largest moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, discovered independently by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius in 1609-1610.
Galileo Mission: U. S. mission to study Jupiter's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere.
The Galileo spacecraft was carried into space and released in 1989 by the shuttle Atlantis. It used its own rocket booster to leave Earth orbit. The Galileo spacecraft arrived at Jupiter in 1995 and completed its two-year primary mission before going on to explore Europa. The 14-year mission ended in 2003. Project Galileo website.
Gamma ray: Gamma rays are like the light we see with our eyes, the x-rays used to probe our bodies in search of problems, and the radio waves that our television sets translate into inane shows. The only difference among these types of electromagnetic radiation is the wavelengths of the waves and how fast they vibrate. Gamma rays are the most energetic (and vibrate the most); radio waves are the least energetic and vibrate the least. When cosmic rays collide with the atoms of the elements in soils and rocks on a planetary surface, the nuclei of the atoms emmit gamma rays — by measuring these gamma rays with a gamma-ray spectrometer it is possible to calculate the abundance and distribution of the chemical elements on the planet's or moon's surface.
Genesis Mission: U. S. mission launched in August, 2001 to observe and collect solar wind samples and return them to Earth. Sample collections were obtained at the L1 point, approximately one million miles from Earth where the gravities of Earth and Sun are balanced. The sample capsule landed back on Earth in September, 2004 in an unexpected crash after its deceleration sensor failed and the parachutes did not open. Nevertheless, solar wind samples were recovered, cleaned, and stored successfully and are now being studied meticulously. Genesis Mission webpage.
Geocentric distance: The distance from Earth.
Geologist: Scientist who studies Earth, its structure, its materials, the physical and chemical processes and changes that occur on the surface and in the interior, and the history of the planet and its life forms. Planetary geologists extend their studies to the Moon, planets, and other solid bodies in the Solar System.
Giant impact theory: An explanation for the origin of the Moon from Earth debris which collected in space after a projectile the size of planet Mars smashed into a growing Earth.
Geomorphology: The study of the shape and form of the landscape, and how the nature of landforms relates to their origin, development, and change over time.
Gigapascal (GPa): Conventional unit of pressure when discussing the deep Earth: 1 GPa = 10 kilobars = 10,000 times air pressure at sea level.
Globular clusters: Groups of thousands to millions of old stars held together in orbits about their own center of mass and arranged in almost symmetrical (spherical) clusters.
GRAIL Mission: U. S. orbital mission to the Moon, with twin spacecraft, launched in September, 2011 as a component of the NASA Discovery Program. The GRAIL (Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory) Mission had two primary objectives: to determine the structure of the lunar interior, from crust to core; and to advance understanding of the thermal evolution of the Moon. These broad objectives are addressed by mapping the gravity field of the Moon to provide the structure of the crust and lithosphere, help understand the Moon's asymmetric thermal evolution, determine the subsurface structure of impact basins and the origin of mascons, ascertain the temporal evolution of crustal brecciation and magmatism, place constraints on the deep interior structure from tides, and place limits on the size of the possible inner core. As a secondary objective, GRAIL observations are used to extend understanding of the internal structure and thermal evolution of other terrestrial bodies.
GRAIL Mission webpage.
Grand Tack model: A physics-based model that depicts Jupiter forming rapidly and then migrating inwards (accompanied by Saturn), then migrating back outwards. The hypothesis proposes that the inner rocky planets owe their sizes, positions, and source of accreting materials to Jupiter's migration and subsequent change of direction ("tacking" in sailing terminology). [Grand Tack webpage at SWRI, Boulder.]
Gravity anomaly: The free-air gravity anomaly is the measured gravity anomaly corrected for the surface elevation at the place of measurement. The Bouguer anomaly takes into account, and corrects for, surface elevation and the density of the rocks in the crust or mantle.
Great Oxygenation Event: 2.4 billion years ago, the irreversible increase in the oxygen content of Earth's near-surface atmosphere. Not only did it affect biological survival on our planet, but it also resulted in an extraordinary increase in mineral diversification.
Hadley-Appenine: Landing site of Apollo 15 on the Moon on July 31, 1971.
Half-life: The amount of time required for half of the mass of a radioactive isotope to decay.
HED: The three linked stony achondritic meteorite groups known as the HEDs are howardites, eucrites, and diogenites. They come from asteroid Vesta. (Data collected by NASA's Dawn Mission, in orbit around Vesta from 2011-2012, strengthed the association between Vesta and HED meteorites.)
Heliocentric distance: The distance from the Sun.
Helium: An element with atomic number 2; symbol: He. It is the second most common element in the Sun and outer planets, but rare on the rocky planets.
Hematite: An iron-oxide mineral (Fe2O3) that may be the cause of the red color on Mars. Courser-grained gray hematite has the same chemical formula as the red variety, but a different crystalline structure. The deposits of gray hematite found in the Terra Meridiani region of Mars may suggest that water once circulated through the region's rock layers.
Hesperian Epoch: The geologic history of Mars has been divided into three broad time periods, or Epochs. From oldest to youngest, these are Noachian, Hesperian, and Amazonian (named after places on Mars). These Epochs are defined by the number of impact craters on the ground surface; older surfaces have more craters. The Hesperian Epoch extends from about 3.5-3.7 to about 2.9-3.3 billion years ago. The actual timing of the Epochs is not known because we have different models of the rates of meteorite falls on Mars.
Highland "soil": Sediment on the surface of the lunar highlands; composed of broken rock and mineral fragments, and glass produced by impact.
Highlands: Oldest exposed areas on the surface of
the Moon; extensively cratered, and chemically distinct from the maria.
Hubble constant: The expansion rate of our universe or rate at which our universe is stretching apart. As of October 2012, the measurement of the Hubble constant is 74.3 kilometers per second per megaparsec (a megaparsec is roughly three million light-years) announced by astronomers using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. This value agrees with a 2011 supernovae study, and improves by a factor of three on a 2001 study. (See the Spitzer news article from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.)
Hydrogen: An element with atomic number 1; symbol: H. It is the most abundant element in the Solar System, making up 90 percent of the Sun. (See also, deuterium, one of the naturally occuring isotopes of hydrogen.) Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are essential for life.
Hydrosphere: The portion of Earth, or other planet, that is water, including liquid water, ice, and water vapor on the surface, underground, or in the atmosphere.
IDP: See Interplanetary dust particles.
Igneous: Rocks or processes involving the formation and solidification of hot, molten magma.
Ilmenite: Opaque mineral found in basalt; nearly pure iron-titanium oxide (FeTiO3.)
Imbrian: The geologic history of Earth's Moon has been divided into five broad time periods, or systems. From oldest to youngest, these are pre-Nectarian, Nectarian, Imbrian, Eratosthenian, and Copernican. These systems are defined by the number of impact craters on the ground surface (more craters = older surface) correlated to the absolute ages determined for the lunar rock samples returned to Earth by the U.

They are chemically distinguished and grouped according to the abundances of the trace elements such as gallium and germanium, as well as nickel. Initially, irons were classified into four groups and were given Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV. Today 13 groups are recognized and designated further by letters A through G according to concentrations of siderophile ("iron-loving") trace elements. Iron meteorites that do not fit into the groups are called ungrouped. The two iron-nickel alloys in iron meteorites are called kamacite (low-nickel content, usually up to 7.5 wt% nickel) and taenite (high-nickel content, ~20 to 50 wt% nickel).
These alloys are rare in terrestrial rocks. (See also Widmanstätten Pattern.)

On the Kelvin scale, the freezing point of water is 273 K and the boiling point is 373 K.
keV: A unit of energy equal to a thousand electron volts (eV). According to the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures: "The electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron in passing through a potential difference of one volt in vacuum. The electron volt is often combined with the SI prefixes."
KREEP: An acronym for a geochemical component in lunar rocks rich in potassium (K), rare-earth elements (REE), phosphorus (P), thorium, and other incompatible elements. These elements are not incorporated into common rock-forming minerals during magma crystallization, hence they become enriched in the residual magma and in the rocks finally formed from it.

Its instruments were designed to provide global maps and data sets of the Moon's composition and magnetic and gravity fields from a low polar orbit. The mission lasted 18 months and ended July 31, 1999 with a controlled crash landing into a crater at the Moon's south pole.
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter: NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is a Moon-orbiting mission launched in the fall of 2008. Its low-polar orbit and instrument payload is acquiring new data in support of future human landing sites and resource exploration including polar volatiles (especially water ice). These data include high-resolution imaging and topography, lunar radiation environment, and global surface composition. Link to the Lunar Observer Laser Altimeter. Link to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) launched with LRO, then traveled independently for a controlled crash on October 9, 2009 into a permanently-shadowed crater at the lunar south pole to support the search for water ice. An estimated 5.6 ± 2.9% by mass water ice was reported in the regolith at the LCROSS impact site, Cabeus crater.

Magma Ocean: Term used to describe the thickness of magma thought to have covered the Moon 4.5 billion years ago. The "magma ocean concept" is the idea that the Moon melted substantially (probably completely) when it formed; this is an important theory in lunar science that is being applied to other planetary bodies, such as Mars. The timing, duration, cooling rates, convection, partial melting, lateral and vertical chemical variations, and overturn of the lunar magma ocean are topics of continuing research.

Magnetosphere: The region around Earth dominated by Earth's magnetic field. In this region, the Earth's magnetic field lines guide the motions of charged particles (ions and electrons). See also plasma sheet.
Magnitude: Astronomical brightness measured on a logarithmic scale, based on the ancient practice of noting that the brightest stars in the sky were of "first importance" or "first magnitude", the next brightest being "second magnitude" etc.
The human eye is a logarithmic detector, and in 1854 Pogson formalized this scale and defined a difference of 5 magnitudes to be exactly a factor of 100 in brightness.
The scale is calibrated to the bright star Vega which is defined to have a magnitude of 0.
For reference, the faintest naked-eye magnitude visible from a dark site is +6.
Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake reached magnitude 0 in late March 1996.
Mantle: A mostly solid layer of Earth lying beneath the crust and above the core; consisting mostly of iron, magnesium, silicon, and oxygen. On other planets and moons, the mantle is the layer between the crust and core.
Mantles contain information about a planet's total composition, a key parameter in understanding planet formation and how the planets vary in composition with distance from the Sun. A second definition of mantle is a smooth blanket of surface material (generally fine-grained, sometimes layered) that was deposited by some process such as wind or water and that now obscures the underlying land.
Mare basalt: Rocks making up the dark, smooth, mare areas of the Moon.
Mare "soil": Sediment on the surface of the lunar maria; fragments of basalt rocks, broken mineral grains, and glass produced by impact.

Scientists use the range measurements to construct precise topographic profiles and maps of Mars in unsurpassed detail.
Mars Pathfinder: The second in NASA's Discovery program of low-cost spacecraft with highly focused science goals, Mars Pathfinder landed successfully on Mars on July 4, 1997. Images, science results, and engineering data were released on the World Wide Web throughout, and beyond, the primary mission dates (July 4 - August 3, 1997.)

JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO): NASA orbital mission to Mars launched August, 2005. MRO is conducting science investigations with a suite of instruments tasked for three purposes: global mapping, regional surveying, and high-resolution targeting of specific spots on the surface.

MSL science instruments include three cameras, four spectrometers, two radiation detectors, and an environmental sensor. MSL homepage.
Martian meteorites: (See SNC meteorites and Meteorite.) Of the ~60,000+ meteorites collected on Earth, only 124 have been identified as meteorites from Mars. They are generally divided into three groups (all with relatively young ages slightly over 1 billion years old). The groups are the Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites. A Martian meteorite that does not fall into one of these groups is ALH 84001, a cumulate rock composed mostly of orthopyroxene, which is much older than all the others with an age of 4.5 billion years. A NASA-sponsored research team reported in 1996 that ALH 84001 may contain evidence of past primitive life on Mars--an idea that remains a topic of great debate and continued investigation. (See Mars Meteorites compiled by Ron Baalke from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.)
Mass Spectrometer: Instrument that produces and measures, usually by electrical means, a mass spectrum. It separates ions according to the ratio of their mass to charge, allowing scientists to determine the abundances of each isotope.

Maturity Index: IS/FeO is a maturity index for lunar soils: The longer the exposure time to solar wind and micrometeorite bombardment, the higher the IS/FeO value. The term IS is the abundance or concentration of nanophase Fe0 in the soil as determined by ferromagnetic resonance measurements. IS is normalized to the total iron content (FeO) of the soil (because the concentration of nanophase Fe0 is proportional to the duration of surface exposure and the amount of FeO in the soil available for reduction). Dr. Richard Morris began making IS measurements of lunar soils in the Magnetics Lab at NASA Johnson Space Center in 1972. (See related: space weathering.)
Megaregolith: Term coined by William K. Hartmann in 1973 to describe the lunar-wide zone of fragmented material developed on the Moon by mixing of impact basin/crater ejecta (transported by ballistic trajectories) and local rock. Estimates of the thickness of this mixed zone are between 1.5 to about 2.5 kilometers.

Most meteorites come from asteroids, but a small number found on Earth come from the Moon (see Lunar meteorites) or Mars (see Martian meteorites). Meteorite types include: iron, stony iron, chondrite, carbonaceous chondrite, and achondrite. A primitive meteorite is defined as a chondrite that experienced minimal heating and aqueous alteration on its parent asteroid.

Nitrogen: An element with atomic number 7; symbol: N. It is common in Earth's atmosphere and along with hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen is essential for life.
Noachian Epoch: The geologic history of Mars has been divided into three broad time periods, or Epochs. From oldest to youngest, these are Noachian, Hesperian, and Amazonian (named after places on Mars). These Epochs are defined by the number of impact craters on the ground surface; older surfaces have more craters. The Noachian Epoch extends from the birth of Mars to about 3.5-3.7 billion years ago. The actual timing of the Epochs is not known because we have different models of the rates of meteorite falls on Mars.

Non-gravitational forces: Forces that alter the path of a comet, which are not caused by gravitational interaction with the Sun and planets.
Typically this refers to uneven outgassing from vents on the comet, which serve to act like rocket nozzles.
Norite: Igneous rock found in the lunar highlands composed of plagioclase and pyroxene.
Nucleosynthesis: Element formation by reactions inside stars.
Nucleus: (see comet) Kilometer-sized "dirty snowball" composed of dust (refractory material) and primarily water-ice which gives rise to all of the features observers associate with comets.
As the nucleus approaches the Sun, the temperatures rise sufficiently to cause the sublimation of the ices.
As the gas leaves the nucleus, it is able to drag some of the dust with it in the low gravity. Sunlight reflected off the dust is what we see as the yellowish coma and tail of the comet, and interaction of the solar radiation with the gases gives us the characteristic blue appearance of the plasma tail.

Olivine: Mineral found in basalt; ranges from Mg2 SiO4 to Fe2 SiO4. The magnesium-rich end-member of the olivine solid-solution series is called forsterite and the iron-rich end-member is called fayalite.
Olympus Mons: Largest shield volcano on Mars. Located in the Tharsis region at 18.5oN, 133.2oW, it is 624 kilometers in diameter and rises 18 kilometers over its surroundings. The volcano is rimmed by a 6-kilometer-high scarp. The summit has nested circular depressions, calderas, formed by collapse after repeated withdrawal of magma and eruptions of lava. The last major summit volcanism on Olympus Mons ceased about 150-400 million years ago, based on crater counting.
Oort cloud: Vast spherical swarm of comets orbiting our Solar System from roughly 2,000 to 100,000 AU. The Oort cloud, while roughly spherical at the largest radius, is wedge-shaped where it merges with the outer planet region in the vicinity of the Kuiper belt of comets. The cloud is divided into different regions of dynamical stability: the Kuiper belt (35-50 AU; affected by planetary perturbations), a dynamically inert region (50-2000 AU; not affected by gravity of planets or stars), the inner Oort cloud (2,000-15,000 AU; affected by galactic tidal forces), and the outer Oort cloud (15,000-100,000 AU; affected by stellar perturbations). The Oort cloud has never been observed, rather its existence is inferred from the careful analysis of the orbits of comets which come in from the cloud.
Recent discoveries of objects in the Kuiper belt have confirmed its existence.
Orange "soil": On the Moon, a mixture of very small dark orange and black glass balls which formed from quickly cooled lava droplets during a pyroclastic eruption.

Oxygen fugacity: A measure of the availability of free or uncombined oxygen in an environment to react chemically; measured in tiny fractions of Earth's atmospheric pressure. For example, in most magmas, oxygen fugacity ranges from 10-10 to 10-18 atmospheres of pressure.
Oxygen isotope plot: Plots of the 17O / 16O versus 18O / 16O ratios (normalized to the Earth value SMOW and plotted as deviations from that value in parts per thousand) show that the data for Earth and Moon fall on the same line, called the terrestrial fractionation line. On these plots, Δ 17O (called "big delta O-17") is a measure of the vertical displacement of any data point from the terrestrial fractionation line. Want to know more details?

[ See the 2017 Reference for this Geophysical Planet Definition. ] It coexists with the definition of a planet from the International Astronomical Union: A celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. [ See the IAU Reference. ] The IAU also designated that a dwarf planet has planet characteristics (a) and (b) but has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and is not a satellite. In this case, Pluto is a dwarf planet.

From oldest to youngest, these are pre-Nectarian, Nectarian, Imbrian, Eratosthenian, and Copernican. These systems are defined by the number of impact craters on the ground surface (more craters = older surface) correlated to the absolute ages determined for the lunar rock samples returned to Earth by the U. S. Apollo missions and unpiloted Soviet Luna missions. The pre-Nectarian system extends from 4.5 billion to 3.9 billion years ago.

Radioactivity: The spontaneous breaking apart, or decay, of unstable nuclei in isotopes.
The unstable radioactive isotope is called the parent, and the products of the decay of the parent are called the daughter isotopes.
Radiocarbon, 14C: The unstable, radioactive isotope of carbon having atomic number 6 and atomic mass 14. It is continuously produced in Earth's upper atmosphere by cosmic ray bombardment. In space, 14C is produced when cosmic rays interact with oxygen in silicate minerals in rocks. The half-life of 14C is 5730 years, which makes this radioactive isotope suitable for dating rocks and archaeological items as old as about 75,000 years.
Radiometric Dating: Technique to determine the age of a rock by measuring the last time the rock being dated was either melted or disturbed sufficiently to rehomogenize its naturally-occurring radioactive elements. This is accomplished because of the decay of long-lived radioactive isotopes. Some of the parent-daughter isotopes used as chronometers to determine the age of extraterrestrial rocks are: aluminum-magnesium, uranium-lead, thorium-lead, rubidium-strontium, potassium-argon, samarium-neodymium, and lutetium-hafnium.

zirconium (Zr), and thorium (Th). The opposite of
refractory is volatile.

On the Moon, this blanket of debris is produced by impacts.
Remote sensing: The acquisition of information on some property of a target object or material without being in physical contact with it. In the broadest terms, this is done by using instruments or scanners to sense and record reflected or emitted energy from the target and then processing the data in order to better analyze and understand the property in question.
Resolution: The degree to which fine details in an image are separated or resolved.
Right ascension (RA): Celestial coordinate which is equivalent to the longitude of an object on Earth. The starting point for longitude on Earth is at Greenwich England, whereas in the celestial coordinate system it is at a point in the sky called the vernal equinox. The two great circles defined by the celestial equator and the ecliptic, which is defined as the plane of the Solar System, cross each other at 2 points: at the vernal equinox (first day of spring) and the autumnal equinox (first day of autumn).
The vernal equinox is the starting point for the RA coordinate system.

In addition to the main spacecraft two smaller relay satellites provided real-time radio transmissions from the far side of the Moon to Earth. The mission lasted 21 months and ended June 10, 2009 with a controlled crash onto the lunar nearside.
Shergottites: One of the three types of meteorites from Mars (the SNC meteorites). The type is named after the Shergotty meteorite, which fell in India in 1865. Basaltic shergottites consist mainly of plagioclase and pyroxenes. They are fine-grained and probably formed as volcanic lava flows or shallow intrusions. Lherzolitic shergottites are related to the basaltic shergottites but are coarser grained, have larger amounts of olivine, and are considered to be cumulate rocks.

Siderophile elements concentrate preferentially into metal (compared to silicate) or form alloys easily with iron. The other types are chalcophile, lithophile, and atmophile elements.
Silicate: A variety of minerals that always contain silicon (Si) and oxygen (O).
Silicon: An element with atomic number 14; symbol: Si. Silicon is the most abundant element besides oxygen in planets, and forms the basis for silicate minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase.

SIMS: (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) A precision measurement technique used to quantitatively analyze the elements and isotopes of materials at microscopic scales (with a typical spatial resolution of 1 micrometer). A SIMS instrument is also called an ion microprobe. For more, see the PSRD article: Ion Microprobe
SMOW: (Standard Mean Ocean Water) A precise definition of the isotopic composition of water on Earth. It serves as a reference standard for comparing hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios. For example, cosmochemists measure the 17O / 16O and 18O / 16O ratios in terms of deviations in parts per thousand from a standard (delta 18O and delta 17O). The usual standard is SMOW.
SNC meteorites: (see Meteorite and Martian Meteorite) General name for three groups of meteorites with relatively young ages (slightly over 1 billion years old) that came from Mars. The groups are the Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites. Another Martian meteorite that does not fall into one of these groups is ALH 84001, a cumulate rock composed mostly of orthopyroxene, which is much older than all the others with an age of 4.5 billion years. (See Mars Meteorites compiled by Ron Baalke from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.)
Snowline: (also called frost line, ice line) is the orbital distance from the Sun (or star) beyond which water ice is stable. Snowlines at greater distances from the Sun (or star) also exist for other volatiles, such as CO2, CO, and CH4 (methane). Inside the snowlines, toward the Sun (star), the volatiles sublimate to gases.

A star must have at least nine times the mass of the Sun to undergo a core-collapse supernova. The extreme heat generated by the explosion makes elements heavier than iron, this is called supernova nucleosynthesis. See also r-process and s-process, and stellar nucleosynthesis.
Taurus-Littrow: Landing site of Apollo 17 on the Moon on Dec. 11, 1972.
Tektite: Tektites are small beads of silica glass that are usually black but can also be shades of brown or green. People used to think they came from the Moon, but now we know they are from the Earth. Tektites formed during impacts on Earth when plumes of vapor and melted rock pierced the atmosphere. The impact debris traveled briefly through space before reentering the atmosphere--spreading the tektites over huge areas called strewn fields. The largest tektites, which are found on land, are several centimeters across. The smallest, which are mainly found in layers of deep sea sediments, are only micrometers across. Microtektites have also been collected from glacial sediment in Antarctica.

Common landforms resulting from tectonic processes are mountain ranges, rift zones, faults, fractured rock, and folded rock masses.
Terrain: Area of the surface with a distinctive geological character.
Thermal inertia: The quality of a material to resist changes in temperature. Solid rock has a higher thermal inertia than loose sand-sized particles, meaning solid rock takes a longer time to change temperature (heat up, cool down) than unconsolidated material. Thermal inertia of the surface of a planetary body can be measured remotely from spacecraft.

Vesta: The brightest of the known asteroids with a diameter of ~530 kilometers. Also called 4 Vesta because it was the fourth asteroid to be discovered (by Olbers in 1807). Vesta is the differentiated parent body of the HED meteorites. (Data collected by NASA's Dawn Mission, in orbit around Vesta from 2011-2012, strengthed the association between Vesta and HED meteorites.)
Viking: U. S. mission to Mars, composed of two spacecraft, launched in 1975. Viking 1 and Viking 2 both consisted of an orbiter and a lander. Primary mission objectives were to obtain high resolution images of the Martian surface, characterize the structure and composition of the atmosphere and surface, and search for evidence of life. Viking Mission website from the National Space Science Data Center.
Viscosity: An internal property of a fluid that offers resistance to flow. If a fluid has a high viscosity, then it strongly resists flow. An example of a low viscosity fluid is water.
Volatile elements: Chemical elements that vaporize (that is, boil) at relatively low temperatures. Examples are water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), potassium (K), sodium (Na), and lead (Pb). The opposite of volatile is refractory.

Voyager: U. S. mission consisting of two spacecraft launched in 1977 to explore Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their moons, rings, and magnetic environments.
It took 2 years for the crafts to reach Jupiter.
The last image was taken in 1989 and now both crafts are headed for the outer Solar System.
Wark-Lovering rims: Thin mineral layers surrounding most coarse-grained CAIs. The layers are typically only a few micrometers thick and unaltered rims have the same sequence of high temperature minerals as in CAIs, including melilite, hibonite, perovskite, spinel, anorthite, pyroxene, and olivine. Multiple hypotheses exist for how these rims formed including condensation, flash-heating, and reaction of the CAI with a Mg-Si-rich reservoir of gas or melt. The rims are named after their discoverers David Wark and John Lovering, University of Melbourne, Australia (1977).
Weathering: The mechanical breakdown and chemical alteration of rocks and minerals at Earth's surface during exposure to air, moisture, and organic matter.
Widmanstätten Pattern: A pattern found in iron meteorites due to a change in crystal structure of iron-nickel metal grains during cooling. This structural change produces a pattern of crystallographically oriented kamacite (low-nickel content, usually up to 7.5 wt% nickel) plates in taenite (high-nickel content, ~20 to 50 wt% nickel).
Yarkovsky Effect: An explanation for the shift in an asteroid's orbit around the Sun due to a thermal thrust caused by the body's uneven heating by sunlight. The illuminated side of an asteroid absorbs the sunlight and heats up. After a short delay produced by thermal inertia, the asteroid re-radiates the thermal energy and this causes a recoil spin that pushes the asteroid away from its current orbital path. In 2003, scientists used radar data from the Arecibo Observatory of Asteroid 6489 "Golevka" to obtain the first-ever measurements of the Yarkovsky Effect. (Named for the Russian engineer who came up with the idea around the year 1900.)
YORP Effect: Also called YORP spin-up or YORP torque, describes a thermal phenomenon that affects the rotation rate and pole orientation of an asteroid, and takes into account the influences of an asteroid's albedo and shape on rotation rate. YORP is an acronym of four names of scientists, Yarkovsky, O'Keefe, Radzievskii, and Paddack.
Zodiacal light: A diffuse brightness in the night sky, shaped in an upward-pointing wedge, created by the reflection of sunlight off concentrations of asteroid and comet dust within the plane of our Solar System.
