Descriptor Terms (Feature Types)
Descriptor terms are intended to represent morphological characteristics, not
geological origin. The WGPSN does not endorse any specific scientific
hypotheses when assigning descriptors.
Chart of landform types created in 1979 by Anne Gifford, who was then at the Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
