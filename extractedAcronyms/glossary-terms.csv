The LRO instruments return global data about the Moon, such as day-night temperature maps, a global geodetic grid, high resolution color imaging and the Moon's UV albedo. However there is particular emphasis on the polar regions of the moon where continuous access to solar illumination may be possible and the prospect of water in the permanently shadowed regions at the poles may exist. Although the objectives of LRO are explorative in nature, the payload includes instruments with considerable heritage from previous planetary science missions, enabling transition, after one year, to a science phase under NASA's Science Mission Directorate. LROC: The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) is one of seven instruments aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. LROC was designed to assess meter scale features to facilitate selection of future landing sites on the Moon and acquire images of the poles every orbit to characterize the polar illumination environment over a full lunar year. In addition to these two main objectives, the LROC team plans to conduct meter-scale mapping of polar regions, 3-dimensional observations to enable derivation of meter-scale surface features, global multi-spectral imaging, and produce a global landform map. LROC images will also be used to map and determine current impact hazards by re-photographing Apollo images. "
