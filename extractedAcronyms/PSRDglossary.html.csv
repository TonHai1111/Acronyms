Term,Description,Context
PSRD,Planetary Science Research Discoveries,"Planetary scientists sharing ideas and discoveries. Planetary Science Research Discoveries (PSRD) is an educational site sharing the latest research by NASA-sponsored scientists on meteorites, asteroids, planets, moons, and other materials in our Solar System. With original support from the Planetary Science Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate and Hawai'i Space Grant Consortium, this site is a vital link for planetary and space sciences, and for learning how science works.

AGB,on the asymptotic giant branch,"Achondrite: A class of stony meteorites that crystallized from magmas. The term means without chondrules. AGB stars: Cool, luminous, and pulsating red giant stars. Most stars in the Universe that have left the main sequence will reach their final evolutionary stage as stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). "
CAIs,polymict.) CAI: Calcium aluminum rich inclusions,"Breccia: Consolidated, fragmental rock consisting of rock, mineral, and/or glass fragments (also called clasts) embedded in a fine-grained matrix. (See also monomict and polymict.) CAI: Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are found in chondritic meteorites. CAIs are primitive objects that formed in the solar nebula before the planets formed. CAIs are light-colored objects rich in refractory elements (that condense at a high temperature). Besides calcium and aluminum, this includes magnesium, titanium, and rare earth elements. CAIs range in size from about a millimeter to a centimeter. Meteoriticists have identified several distinct varieties of CAIs, but all share a high temperature origin. Some might be condensates from the solar nebula. Other CAIs might be evaporation residues. See also FUN CAI. "
EL,into the low iron,"Chirality: In chemistry, the term describing a molecule that, due to its geometry, lacks an internal plane of symmetry and has a non-superposable mirror image. These mirror images can be designated l and d. Many amino acids are chiral. Life on Earth uses l-amino acids to make proteins. Chondrite: An abundant class of stony meteorites with chemical compositions similar to that of the Sun and characterized by the presence of chondrules (see definition below). Chondrites come from asteroids that did not melt when formed and are designated as H, L, LL, E, or C depending on chemical compositions. The H, L, and LL types are called ordinary chondrites. The L chondrites are composed of silicate minerals (mostly olivine and pyroxene, but feldspar as well), metallic nickel-iron, and iron sulfide (called troilite). Most L chondrites are severely shocked-damaged, probably by a large impact on the asteroid in which they formed. The E type are called enstatite chondrites, a rare type that formed under very reducing conditions and are composed primarily of a magnesium silicate called enstatite. They are subdivided into the low-iron (EL) chemical group and the high-iron (HL) group. The C –carbonaceous chondrites– contain water-bearing minerals and carbon compounds including a variety of organic molecules such as amino acids. Carbonaceous chondrites are the most primitive meteorites--primitive in a chemical way. For example, the CI group of carbonaceous chondrites are closest in composition to the photosphere (visible surface) of the Sun. "

SMOW,in Earth's standard mean ocean water,"Descartes: Lunar highlands site of Apollo 16 landing on April 21, 1972. Deuterium: An isotope of hydrogen; also called heavy hydrogen (not radioactive). Its nucleus contains a proton and a neutron; hydrogen's nucleus contains only a proton. As a reference, the measured deuterium/hydrogen ratio (D/H) in Earth's standard mean ocean water (SMOW) is 1.558x10-4. In our Solar System, the water D/H ratio is a kind of fingerprint of where icy planetesimals formed; the ratio increases with increasing formation distance from the Sun. "
EDS,Analysis: Energy dispersive spectroscopy,"Emissivity: The ratio of radiant flux (total power of electromagnetic radiation including infrared, ultraviolet, and visible per unit of area) from a body to that from a black body at the same kinetic temperature. Energy Dispersive Analysis: Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) is an analytical technique used to determine elemental abundances in a sample. It does this by detecting the energy of X-rays emitted from a sample when bombarded with electrons. Because each element emits a characteristic X-ray energy, it is possible to determine the chemical composition of a sample. "

The bodies are called Kuiper Belt Objects (KBO) or Edgeworth/Kuiper Belt Objects or Trans-Neptunian Objects. The brightest known is dwarf-planet Pluto. Most of the short-period comets found in the inner solar system probably originated in the Kuiper Belt. In 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto, making the first up-close exploration of a KBO. In January 2019, the New Horizons spacecraft flew past KBO 2014 MU69, nicknamed Ultima Thule, a primordial, 35-kilometer long, two-lobed body. "
