Term,Description,Context
SSA,Space Situational Awareness,"Space Weather service definitions Accuracy of service An estimate of the closeness of agreement between service output and the associated observable conditions. In practice this is reflected by an uncertainty value based on known performance statistics. Operational A product, tool or service that has been validated and certified suitable for use in the intended operational context. Pre-operational A product tool or service that has been validated against the criteria for use in the intended operational context but is not yet being demonstrated to meet operational use. Product Derived data generated using one or more Space Weather tool or model. A Product is a digital file(s) delivered to members of a user community from an operational element of the system that has a defined format and is archived or is reproducible. The generation of a product or a family of products is part of a service of the SWE Service Network or to the SWE Service Network. Software tools made available to users or a technical report are not considered as products. Reliability The ability of an element of the SWE service network to perform its required functions under its given operational conditions. The reliability of an element of the system is considered ""undetermined"" until it has been evaluated. When the element fulfils all predetermined criteria, it can be considered ""reliable"". Service A service is a collection of derived data products, software tools, technical reports and associated user support addressing the high-level requirements of a specific group of users as defined by the Customer Requirements Document. The ESA Space Safety Programme (S2P) The goal of ESAâ€™s Space Safety Programme is to contribute to the protection of our planet, humanity and assets in space and on Earth from threats originating in Space and to contribute to Europeâ€™s ability to safeguard its affected infrastructure from such threats as a service to its society. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) ESA programme starting in 2009. The objective of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system is to support the European independent utilisation of and access to space for research or services, through providing timely and quality data, information, services and knowledge regarding the environment, the threats, and the sustainable exploitation of the outer space. Tool(Kit) A software application which provides the end user with the facility to retrieve and/or process and further modify a given set of products according to their needs as part of a SWE Service. User requirement The specification of what the user expects of the product, service or system to provide in order to fulfil their needs. Validation Validation is a process which demonstrates that the product is able to accomplish its intended use in the intended operational environment. The status of the product following validation is ""validated"". Verification is a pre-requisite for validation. Verification Verification is a process which demonstrates through the provision of objective evidence that the product is designed and produced according to its specifications and the agreed deviations, and is free of defects. Verification can be accomplished by one or more of the following methods: "

IP,mass ejection driven interplanetary,"Coronal Mass Ejection An outflow of plasma from or through the solar corona. CMEs are often, but not always, associated with erupting prominences, disappearing solar filaments, and/or flares. CMEs vary widely in structure, density, and velocity. Large and fast CMEs can approach masses of 1.6 × 10^12 kg and approach velocities over 2000 km/s. Earth impacting CMEs can result in significant geomagnetic storms. Types of coronal mass ejections launched toward Earth are called ""halo CMEs"" because as they approach Earth, they appear larger than the Sun, making a halo of bright coronal emission completely around it. Cosmic Rays General term comprising galactic cosmic rays, anomalous cosmic rays and solar cosmic rays (e.g. solar energetic particles). Galactic cosmic rays: High-energy charged particles (up to 10^21 eV) originating from outside the solar system. Anomalous cosmic rays: Charged particles (approx. 10-100 MeV) originating from neutral interstellar atoms that have been ionised by solar UV radiation after entering the heliosphere. Solar energetic particles: Charged particles (from a few keV up to GeV) originating in at least two distinct locations, namely the solar flare and the coronal mass ejection-driven interplanetary (IP) shock. Commonly referred to as solar energetic particles when they are observed in IP space and near Earth. "
SEP,Solar Energetic Particle,"Galactic cosmic rays: High-energy charged particles (up to 10^21 eV) originating from outside the solar system. Anomalous cosmic rays: Charged particles (approx. 10-100 MeV) originating from neutral interstellar atoms that have been ionised by solar UV radiation after entering the heliosphere.

Commonly referred to as solar energetic particles when they are observed in IP space and near Earth. Micro-particle Space object with size below one millimetre and above 0.1 micrometer. Single Event Effects With reference to the effects of energetic particles on spacecraft microcircuits - an unexpected change in the logic state of a single digital bit. SEUs can be either soft (the microcircuit is not damaged and can be rewritten to either state), or a latch up, which cannot easily be reset. Solar activity The collective term for all active phenomena on the Sun, including sunspots, faculae, active regions, plages, active prominences, and flares. Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) event A solar energetic particle event is a sudden release of particles (protons, electrons and heavy ions) with energy ranging from a few tens of keV to GeV and associated with solar eruptive phenomena or interplanetary coronal mass ejections. Solar Flare A solar flare is an intense burst of radiative energy across the entire EM spectrum, with the largest enhancements in the X-ray, EUV and radio portions. Powerful flares are often, but not always, accompanied by a CME. Flares are labelled with a letter and number. The letter is the flare class and indicates the peak intensity in W/m2 of X-rays in the 1-8 Ångstrom wavelength range as measured at Earth by the GOES spacecraft. The weakest one is A class followed by the classes B, C, M and X, each letter represents a 10-fold increase in energy output. Within each letter class there is a finer scale from 1-9 although X-class flares could be higher. Spacecraft anomaly Anomalous or unexpected behaviour of a spacecraft or any of its subsystems. Spacecraft effects Effects observed as a result of the interaction of a spacecraft or device with the local space environment. Examples include radiation dose, single event effects, sensor background accumulated charge, spacecraft anomalies and damage caused by microparticle impacts. Space Weather Space Weather is the physical and phenomenological state of natural space environments. The associated discipline aims, through observation, monitoring, analysis and modelling, at understanding and predicting the state of the Sun, the interplanetary and planetary environments, and the solar and non-solar driven perturbations that affect them, and also at forecasting and nowcasting the potential impacts on biological and technological systems. Space Weather event A time-limited condition of the space environment (e.g. Solar Flare, Solar energetic particle event, Substorm). Often this involves a propagating disturbance (e.g. CME or interplanetary shock). Susceptibility The response of a material or substance to a change in conditions. In the spacecraft case, this may be characterised by e.g. "
