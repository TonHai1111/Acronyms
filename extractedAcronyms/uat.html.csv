The absolute magnitude is usually deduced from the visual magnitude, measured through a V filter (UBV system), when it is written as M_V. If it is defined for another wavelength, it gets another index (U, B, etc). If the radiation on all wavelengths is included, it becomes absolute bolometric magnitude, M_bol. The Sun has the absolute magnitude +4.8. Most of the stars have absolute magnitudes ranging between -9 (supergiants) and +19 (red dwarfs).magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/10abundance-ratios (Preliminary)Abundance ratiosThe relative amount of a given chemical element with respect to other elements.chemical-abundancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/11accelerating-universe (Preliminary)Accelerating universeThe deduction based on the observation that the most distant Type Ia supernovae are fainter than that expected from their redshifts in a matter-only dominated expanding Universe. The faintness is attributed to larger distances resulting from an accelerating Universe driven by presence of a new component with strongly negative pressure. This component that makes the Universe accelerate is named dark energy.deceleration-parameterSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/12accretion (Preliminary)AccretionThe process by which an object increases its mass under the influence of its gravitational attraction. Accretion plays a key role in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. In particular stars result from the accretion of material by a protostar from a surrounding molecular cloud. The accumulation of mass on the protostar involves the formation of an accretion disk. Theoretical and observational investigations of protostars and newborn stars indicate the important role of magnetic fields in this process. They favor the magnetospheric accretion model for mass transfer from the circumstellar disk onto the newborn star. In this model, the stellar magnetosphere truncates the disk at a few stellar radii. Gas from the disk accretes onto the star along the magnetic field lines and hits the stellar surface at approximately the free fall velocity, causing a strong accretion shock. Various emission lines are formed in the infalling magnetospheric flow. Moreover, optical/ultraviolet excess continuum emission is produced in the accretion shocks. The accretion is accompanied by mass ejection through collimated bipolar jets.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/14Narrowerstellar-accretionbondi-accretiongalaxy-accretionachondrites (Preliminary)AchondritesA class of stony meteorites that lack chondrules.

The nucleus emits high energy radiation (gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet) and shows variability over various time-scales, sometimes very short (hours to weeks). Emission line spectra reveal high velocity motions up to 10^4 km s^-1. AGNs are divided into two main types. Type I refers to an AGN whose nucleus is visible (the spectra has both narrow and broad emission lines), while in type II AGN, the broad line region (BLR) is obscured and the lines are very narrow. This may be due either to the viewing angle or some intrinsic difference in structure.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-nuclei, active-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/16Related#radio-sources#agn-host-galaxiesNarrowerradio-jetsquasarsradio-coresradio-plumeslow-luminosity-active-galactic-nucleiradio-active-galactic-nucleihigh-luminosity-active-galactic-nucleiradio-lobesrelativistic-disksx-ray-active-galactic-nucleiblazarsradio-hot-spotsactive-galaxies (Preliminary)Active galaxiesA galaxy that produces huge amounts of energy at its center, which cannot be attributed to normal processes from stars, interstellar medium, and their interactions. There are several types of active galaxies: Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and blazars. All of these objects show brightness variations, some as short as 3 hours. These fluctuations indicate a relatively very small size for the central object, because an object cannot vary in brightness faster than light can travel across it. For example, an object that is one light-year in diameter cannot vary significantly in brightness over a period of less than one year.galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/17Narroweractive-galactic-nucleibl-lacertae-objectsstarburst-galaxiesagn-host-galaxiesblazarsliner-galaxiesharo-galaxiesradio-galaxiesmarkarian-galaxiesactive-solar-chromosphere (Preliminary)Active solar chromospheresolar-chromosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1980active-solar-corona (Preliminary)Active solar coronasolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1988active-sun (Preliminary)Active sunThe Sun during its 11-year cycle of activity when spots, flares, prominences, and variations in radiofrequency radiation are at a maximum.solar-cycleSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/18Related#quiet-sunadaptive-interferometry (Preliminary)Adaptive interferometryinterferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/19ae-stars (Preliminary)Ae starsearly-type-emission-stars, a-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/20Narrowerherbig-ae-be-starsaerolites (Preliminary)AerolitesA stony meteorite consisting of silicate minerals.

NEAs,a class of near Earth asteroids,"Because the Earth revolves around the Sun, we observe the sky from a constantly moving position in space. Therefore, we should expect to see an annual effect, in which the positions of nearby objects appear to oscillate back and forth in response to our motion around the Sun. This does in fact happen, but the distances to even the nearest stars are so great that we need to make careful observations with a telescope to detect it.

The sextant consists of a 60° graduated arc, or limb, a small telescope, and two mirrors. Only half of one of the mirrors, the horizon glass, is silvered and, like the telescope, it is fastened to the frame supporting the limb. The other mirror, the index mirror, moves with an index arm pivoted at the center of the arc. The index arm is equipped with a vernier which moves along the limb. An object in direction S can be observed in the telescope through the un-silvered portion of the horizon glass. By moving the index arm, the second object S' is made to coincide with S in the telescope. According to the law of reflection, the angle between S and S' is double the angle between the mirrors. The angular distance between the objects can therefore be obtained from the measurement of angles between the planes of the mirrors.early-astronomical-instrumentsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/93astronomical-simulations (Preliminary)Astronomical simulationsThe construction of a mathematical model to reproduce the characteristics of an astronomical phenomenon, system, or process, often using a computer, in order to infer information or solve problems.astronomy-softwareSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1857Narrowermagnetohydrodynamical-simulationshydrodynamical-simulationsradiative-transfer-simulationsn-body-simulationsastronomical-site-protection (Preliminary)Astronomical site protectionastronomical-researchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/94Related#observatoriesastronomical-techniques (Preliminary)Astronomical techniquesobservational-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1684Narrowerastrometryspectroscopyanalytical-mathematicscoronagraphic-imagingmagnetospheric-radio-emissionsinterferometrydoppler-imagingoptical-observationfield-of-viewastronomical-opticsreverberation-mappingremote-sensingscaling-relationsphotometryfaber-jackson-distancedrift-scan-imaginghigh-time-resolution-astrophysicspolarimetryhigh-angular-resolutiondirect-imagingpointing-accuracydoppler-shiftastronomical-object-identificationcalibrationccd-observationastronomical-unit (Preliminary)Astronomical unitA unit of length equal to 149,597,870,700 m exactly, with symbol 'au' (re-definition at the International Astronomical Union's 28th General Assembly in Beijing, China, August 20-31).

The last time it appeared was in 1986, and it is predicted to return in 2061. Its earliest recorded sighting is traced back to 240 BC in China. In 1705 Edmond Halley used Newton's new theory of gravitation to determine the orbits of comets from their recorded positions in the sky as a function of time. He found that the bright comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet, and predicted its return for 1758.

The nucleus is a mass of dust and frozen gases. When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma, which is later swept into an elongated tail. Reliable measurements of cometary nuclei indicate sizes from a few km to 10 or 20 km. The nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp is one of the largest (perhaps 40 km). The composition of the nucleus is determined by measuring the composition of the coma (except for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko). The dominant volatile is water, followed by carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water) and many other molecules at a lower level.cometsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2160Narrowercomet-surfacescomet-volatilescomet-interiorscomet-origins (Preliminary)Comet originsplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2203Related#cometscomet-surfaces (Preliminary)Comet surfacescomet-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2161comet-tail-streamers (Preliminary)Comet tail streamerscomet-tailsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/273comet-tails (Preliminary)Comet tailsA formation of gas and/or dust that streams away from the coma of many comets under the influence of the Sun's radiation pressure and the solar wind.cometsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/274Narrowercomet-tail-streamerscomet-volatiles (Preliminary)Comet volatilescomet-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2162cometary-globules (Preliminary)Cometary globulesA relatively small cloud of dust and gas in the interstellar medium shaped like a comet with a bright-rimmed head. Cometary globules are situated near young massive stars with a strong stellar wind. The wind ionizes gases on the side facing the O stars and sweep away the low-density gas toward the tail. Cometary globules are believed to be molecular cloud condensations, which are so dense that they are not disrupted when an H II region expands into the molecular cloud surrounding it. The Rosette nebula is a good example of an H II region which shows an abundance of cometary globules.dark-interstellar-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/276cometary-nebulae (Preliminary)Cometary nebulaeprotostars, nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/278comets (Preliminary)CometsA small body of gas and dust which revolves around the Sun in a usually very elliptical or even parabolic orbit. It is seen to be composed of a head and often with a spectacular gaseous tail extending a great distance from the head. The rocky-icy head is called the comet nucleus. As the comet nears the Sun, the increased temperature causes the ice in the nucleus to sublimate and form a gaseous halo around the nucleus, called the coma. Comets often possess two tails, a dust tail that lies in the orbit behind the comet generated by surface activity, and a brighter, ionized gas tail, that points away from the Sun, driven by solar wind. Cometary reservoirs are thought to represent primordial solar system material. A comet with a dust coating on its surface that inhibits gas production might be classified as an asteroid. Because of this ambiguity, objects such as Chiron, Centaur asteroid, have been reclassified as comets.

The radiation rate is proportional to the square of the density, and the cooling time, which remains in the outer parts too large, becomes smaller than the Hubble time in the core. As a result, the central regions of clusters of galaxies cool down; and since in the center of a cluster gas pressure and gravitational attraction are in equilibrium, the gas density has to rise to maintain the pressure necessary for supporting the outer layers of gas. To cause its density to rise, the cooled gas has to flow inward. As the densest gas, which cools quickest, is already concentrated in the center of the cluster, the inward flow will start at the center, soon followed by the outer layers. This flow of gas is called the cooling flow. Cooling flows are moderated through feedback due to the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the central galaxy. The gas inflow to the center fuels the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The latter then heats again the gas through its radio jets.intracluster-medium, cool-intergalactic-mediumSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2028core-collapse-supernovae (Preliminary)Core-collapse supernovaeA supernova arising from the core collapse of a massive star.supernovaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/304Narrowertype-ii-supernovaetype-ic-supernovaetype-ib-supernovaecoronagraphic-imaging (Preliminary)Coronagraphic imagingdirect-imaging, astronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/313corotating-streams (Preliminary)Corotating streamsinterplanetary-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/314cosmic-abundances (Preliminary)Cosmic abundanceschemical-abundancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/315Related#cosmochemistrycosmic-anisotropy (Preliminary)Cosmic anisotropycosmic-microwave-background-radiationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/316cosmic-background-radiation (Preliminary)Cosmic background radiationrecombination-cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/317Narrowercosmic-microwave-background-radiationcosmic-electrodynamics (Preliminary)Cosmic electrodynamicsplasma-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/318cosmic-inflation (Preliminary)Cosmic inflationA brief exponential expansion of the Universe postulated to have occurred 10-35 seconds after the Big Bang, in response to the separation of the strong interaction from the electroweak interaction.

Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays.

Dark energy seems to be a kind of anti-gravity force and is supposed to be related to vacuum energy. Where gravity pulls things together at the more local level, dark energy tears them apart on the grander scale. The acceleration equation, one of Einstein's equations for the homogeneous Universe, indicates that if the Universe is accelerating, the pressure of the driving component should be strongly negative.

In 1705 Edmond Halley used Newton's new theory of gravitation to determine the orbits of comets from their recorded positions in the sky as a function of time. He found that the bright comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet, and predicted its return for 1758.

The nucleus is a mass of dust and frozen gases. When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma, which is later swept into an elongated tail. Reliable measurements of cometary nuclei indicate sizes from a few km to 10 or 20 km. The nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp is one of the largest (perhaps 40 km). The composition of the nucleus is determined by measuring the composition of the coma (except for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko). The dominant volatile is water, followed by carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water) and many other molecules at a lower level.cometsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2160Narrowercomet-surfacescomet-volatilescomet-interiorscomet-origins (Preliminary)Comet originsplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2203Related#cometscomet-surfaces (Preliminary)Comet surfacescomet-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2161comet-tail-streamers (Preliminary)Comet tail streamerscomet-tailsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/273comet-tails (Preliminary)Comet tailsA formation of gas and/or dust that streams away from the coma of many comets under the influence of the Sun's radiation pressure and the solar wind.cometsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/274Narrowercomet-tail-streamerscomet-volatiles (Preliminary)Comet volatilescomet-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2162cometary-globules (Preliminary)Cometary globulesA relatively small cloud of dust and gas in the interstellar medium shaped like a comet with a bright-rimmed head.

Cometary globules are believed to be molecular cloud condensations, which are so dense that they are not disrupted when an H II region expands into the molecular cloud surrounding it. The Rosette nebula is a good example of an H II region which shows an abundance of cometary globules.dark-interstellar-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/276cometary-nebulae (Preliminary)Cometary nebulaeprotostars, nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/278comets (Preliminary)CometsA small body of gas and dust which revolves around the Sun in a usually very elliptical or even parabolic orbit. It is seen to be composed of a head and often with a spectacular gaseous tail extending a great distance from the head. The rocky-icy head is called the comet nucleus. As the comet nears the Sun, the increased temperature causes the ice in the nucleus to sublimate and form a gaseous halo around the nucleus, called the coma. Comets often possess two tails, a dust tail that lies in the orbit behind the comet generated by surface activity, and a brighter, ionized gas tail, that points away from the Sun, driven by solar wind. Cometary reservoirs are thought to represent primordial solar system material. A comet with a dust coating on its surface that inhibits gas production might be classified as an asteroid. Because of this ambiguity, objects such as Chiron, Centaur asteroid, have been reclassified as comets. Comets are primarily composed of amorphous water ice, but also contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water), and many other molecules at a lower level.small-solar-system-bodiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/280Related#aperiodic-comets#astrophysical-masers#interplanetary-medium#comet-dynamics#comet-origins#near-earth-objectsNarrowerlong-period-cometsdirty-snowball-modelcomet-nucleinear-sun-cometsmain-belt-cometscomet-tailscomet-halleycomaeshort-period-cometscommon-envelope-binary-stars (Preliminary)Common envelope binary starsinteracting-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2156Related#common-envelope-evolutioncommon-envelope-evolution (Preliminary)Common envelope evolutionmultiple-star-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2154Related#common-envelope-binary-starscompact-binary-stars (Preliminary)Compact binary starsA binary star system which is composed of a collapsed object (degenerate dwarf, neutron star, or black hole) in orbit with a low-mass (≤ 0.5 M_sol) secondary star, wherein the collapsed star accretes matter from its companion.

The radiation rate is proportional to the square of the density, and the cooling time, which remains in the outer parts too large, becomes smaller than the Hubble time in the core. As a result, the central regions of clusters of galaxies cool down; and since in the center of a cluster gas pressure and gravitational attraction are in equilibrium, the gas density has to rise to maintain the pressure necessary for supporting the outer layers of gas. To cause its density to rise, the cooled gas has to flow inward. As the densest gas, which cools quickest, is already concentrated in the center of the cluster, the inward flow will start at the center, soon followed by the outer layers. This flow of gas is called the cooling flow. Cooling flows are moderated through feedback due to the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the central galaxy. The gas inflow to the center fuels the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The latter then heats again the gas through its radio jets.intracluster-medium, cool-intergalactic-mediumSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2028core-collapse-supernovae (Preliminary)Core-collapse supernovaeA supernova arising from the core collapse of a massive star.supernovaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/304Narrowertype-ii-supernovaetype-ic-supernovaetype-ib-supernovaecoronagraphic-imaging (Preliminary)Coronagraphic imagingdirect-imaging, astronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/313corotating-streams (Preliminary)Corotating streamsinterplanetary-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/314cosmic-abundances (Preliminary)Cosmic abundanceschemical-abundancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/315Related#cosmochemistrycosmic-anisotropy (Preliminary)Cosmic anisotropycosmic-microwave-background-radiationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/316cosmic-background-radiation (Preliminary)Cosmic background radiationrecombination-cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/317Narrowercosmic-microwave-background-radiationcosmic-electrodynamics (Preliminary)Cosmic electrodynamicsplasma-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/318cosmic-inflation (Preliminary)Cosmic inflationA brief exponential expansion of the Universe postulated to have occurred 10-35 seconds after the Big Bang, in response to the separation of the strong interaction from the electroweak interaction.

Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays.

Assuming the existence of dark energy is a way to explain recent observations that the Universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate. Dark energy seems to be a kind of anti-gravity force and is supposed to be related to vacuum energy. Where gravity pulls things together at the more local level, dark energy tears them apart on the grander scale. The acceleration equation, one of Einstein's equations for the homogeneous Universe, indicates that if the Universe is accelerating, the pressure of the driving component should be strongly negative. The first indication of dark energy was provided by the observation of Type Ia supernovae. Other probes of dark energy are: baryon acoustic oscillations, weak gravitational lensing, and clusters of galaxies. In the standard model of cosmology, dark energy currently accounts for almost 74% of the total mass-energy of the Universe. Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant and exotic component such as quintessence.cosmological-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/351Narrowercosmological-constantquintessencedark-interstellar-clouds (Preliminary)Dark interstellar cloudsinterstellar-clouds, nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/352Narrowerinfrared-dark-cloudsbok-globulescometary-globulesdark-matter (Preliminary)Dark matterMatter that has no radiation and therefore cannot be detected directly, but whose presence can be inferred from dynamical phenomena produced by its gravitational influence. The existence of dark matter is deduced mainly from the rotational speeds of galaxies, velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter plays also a central role in cosmic structure formation. There exists a large number of non-baryonic dark matter candidates. They include, the hypothetical stable particles WIMPs, neutralinos, axions, gravitinos, etc. Among unstable candidates are gravitinos with mild R-parity violation and sterile neutrinos.intergalactic-medium, high-energy-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/353Related#particle-astrophysics#cosmology#navarro-frenk-white-profileNarrowerwarm-dark-mattercold-dark-matterbaryonic-dark-matterhot-dark-matterdark-matter-density (Preliminary)Dark matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/354dark-matter-detectors (Preliminary)Dark matter detectorsastronomical-detectorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/355dark-matter-distribution (Preliminary)Dark matter distributionlarge-scale-structure-of-the-universeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/356db-stars (Preliminary)DB starsA white dwarf whose spectrum shows strong He I in the absence of hydrogen or metal lines.helium-rich-stars, white-dwarf-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/358dc-stars (Preliminary)DC starsA white dwarf showing a continuous spectrum with no readily apparent lines.white-dwarf-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/0ddo-classification (Preliminary)DDO classificationgalaxy-classification-systemsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/359ddo-photometry (Preliminary)DDO photometrymedium-band-photometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/360de-excitation-rates (Preliminary)De-excitation ratesatomic-physics, molecular-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2066de-sitter-universe (Preliminary)de Sitter universeA solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity which contains no ordinary matter (Ω_M = 0) or radiation (Ω_R = 0), is Euclidean (k = 0), but has a cosmological constant (Ω_Λ > 0).

Bodies with masses less than Chandrasekhar's limit (1.4 solar masses) are supported by electron degeneracy pressure and have densities of about 10^6 kg/m^3. In collapsed stars of mass above 1.4 solar masses, gravity will overwhelm electron degeneracy and further collapse ensues. Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons, so producing a neutron star. Because neutrons, like electrons, are fermions and therefore subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, at high enough densities, about 10^14 kg/m^3, neutron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse of the star. For masses larger than 2-3 solar masses, even neutron degeneracy cannot prevent further collapse, and a black hole is formed.stellar-remnantsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/367delta-cepheid-variable-stars (Preliminary)Delta Cepheid variable starsThe prototype of classical Cepheid variables, which is a pulsating yellow supergiant. John Goodricke was the first in 1784 to discover its variability. The star shows a quick and sharp rise from minimum to maximum, and slowly declines to its minimum again. The changes in brightness are accompanied by and principally caused by changes in stellar temperature and also by changes in radius. δ Cephei was actually the second Cepheid variable to be discovered. The first one, Eta Aquilae, had been discovered earlier the same year by Edward Pigott. δ Cephei varies with a period of 5.366341 days (or 5 days 8 hours 37.5 minutes) from magnitude 3.48, spectral type F5 Ib in its maximum to magnitude 4.37, spectral type G2 Ib in its minimum.

In diffuse interstellar clouds photoabsorption of the background ultraviolet (UV) radiation field is an important dissociating and ionizing process. Typical densities and temperatures of diffuse clouds are 10^2 to 10^3 cm^-3 and 20 to 100 K respectively.

Their prototype is U Geminorum star. Optically, dwarf nova eruptions have amplitudes of 2-6 mag in V, a duration of a few to 20 days and a recurrence time-scale of weeks to years. Dwarf novae are thought to be semidetached binary stars consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting via Roche lobe overflow from a companion which is usually a late-type, generally main-sequence star. DN outbursts are usually attributed to the release of gravitational energy resulting from an instability in the accretion disk or by sudden mass transfers through the disk.novaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/418Narrowerz-camelopardalis-starswz-sagittae-starssu-ursae-majoris-starssx-arietis-variable-starsu-geminorum-starsdwarf-planets (Preliminary)Dwarf planetsA new category of astronomical objects in the solar system introduced in a resolution by the 26th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on August 24, 2006. The characterizing properties are as follows: 1) It is in orbit around the Sun; 2) It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape; 3) It has not 'cleared the neighbourhood' around its orbit; and 4) It is not a satellite of a planet, or other non-stellar body. The property 3 reclassified Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet because it has not cleared the neighborhood of its orbit (the Kuiper Belt). The largest known dwarf planets are: Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, and 2015 RR245.solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/419Narrowerceresplutodwarf-spheroidal-galaxies (Preliminary)Dwarf spheroidal galaxiesA subtype of dwarf ellipticals (dwarf elliptical galaxy), which are companion to the Milky Way and other similar galaxies. The first example of such objects was discovered by Harlow Shapley (1938) in the constellation Sculptor. 22 such galaxies are known currently to orbit the Milky Way and at least 36 exist in the Local Group of galaxies. Nearby galaxy clusters such as the Virgo, Fornax, Centaurus, and Coma clusters contain hundreds to thousands of individual dSph galaxies. These galaxies have very low surface brightnesses, as low as only 1% that of the sky background. They are also among the smallest, least luminous galaxies known. Most of the radiation from dSph galaxies is emitted by stars in the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The lack of strong emission lines, infrared, or radio emission suggests that these galaxies are generally devoid of interstellar medium. The velocities of stars within dSph galaxies are so high that them must be disrupting. However, the bulk of mass in these galaxies might be undetected. Dynamical models that include dark matter do adequately explain the velocity dispersion of the stars in all dSph systems. In the most extreme cases, only 1% of the mass of the galaxy is visible. Many of the Local Group dSph galaxies show evidence for star formation more recent than 10 Gyr.dwarf-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/420Narrowersagittarius-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxyfornax-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxyursa-minor-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxydwarf-stars (Preliminary)Dwarf starsA star that burns its hydrogen content to produce its energy and therefore belongs to the main-sequence luminosity class.stellar-evolutionary-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2053Related#main-sequence-stars#main-sequenceNarrowerk-dwarf-starsa-dwarf-starst-dwarfsg-dwarf-starsf-dwarf-starso-dwarf-starsm-dwarf-starsb-dwarf-starsdynamical-evolution (Preliminary)Dynamical evolutioncosmological-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/421dynamical-friction (Preliminary)Dynamical frictionThe gravitational interaction between a relatively massive body and a field of much less massive bodies through which the massive body travels.

He found that the bright comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet, and predicted its return for 1758.

When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma, which is later swept into an elongated tail. Reliable measurements of cometary nuclei indicate sizes from a few km to 10 or 20 km. The nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp is one of the largest (perhaps 40 km). The composition of the nucleus is determined by measuring the composition of the coma (except for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko). The dominant volatile is water, followed by carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water) and many other molecules at a lower level.cometsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2160Narrowercomet-surfacescomet-volatilescomet-interiorscomet-origins (Preliminary)Comet originsplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2203Related#cometscomet-surfaces (Preliminary)Comet surfacescomet-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2161comet-tail-streamers (Preliminary)Comet tail streamerscomet-tailsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/273comet-tails (Preliminary)Comet tailsA formation of gas and/or dust that streams away from the coma of many comets under the influence of the Sun's radiation pressure and the solar wind.cometsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/274Narrowercomet-tail-streamerscomet-volatiles (Preliminary)Comet volatilescomet-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2162cometary-globules (Preliminary)Cometary globulesA relatively small cloud of dust and gas in the interstellar medium shaped like a comet with a bright-rimmed head.

Cometary globules are believed to be molecular cloud condensations, which are so dense that they are not disrupted when an H II region expands into the molecular cloud surrounding it. The Rosette nebula is a good example of an H II region which shows an abundance of cometary globules.dark-interstellar-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/276cometary-nebulae (Preliminary)Cometary nebulaeprotostars, nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/278comets (Preliminary)CometsA small body of gas and dust which revolves around the Sun in a usually very elliptical or even parabolic orbit. It is seen to be composed of a head and often with a spectacular gaseous tail extending a great distance from the head. The rocky-icy head is called the comet nucleus. As the comet nears the Sun, the increased temperature causes the ice in the nucleus to sublimate and form a gaseous halo around the nucleus, called the coma. Comets often possess two tails, a dust tail that lies in the orbit behind the comet generated by surface activity, and a brighter, ionized gas tail, that points away from the Sun, driven by solar wind. Cometary reservoirs are thought to represent primordial solar system material. A comet with a dust coating on its surface that inhibits gas production might be classified as an asteroid. Because of this ambiguity, objects such as Chiron, Centaur asteroid, have been reclassified as comets. Comets are primarily composed of amorphous water ice, but also contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water), and many other molecules at a lower level.small-solar-system-bodiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/280Related#aperiodic-comets#astrophysical-masers#interplanetary-medium#comet-dynamics#comet-origins#near-earth-objectsNarrowerlong-period-cometsdirty-snowball-modelcomet-nucleinear-sun-cometsmain-belt-cometscomet-tailscomet-halleycomaeshort-period-cometscommon-envelope-binary-stars (Preliminary)Common envelope binary starsinteracting-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2156Related#common-envelope-evolutioncommon-envelope-evolution (Preliminary)Common envelope evolutionmultiple-star-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2154Related#common-envelope-binary-starscompact-binary-stars (Preliminary)Compact binary starsA binary star system which is composed of a collapsed object (degenerate dwarf, neutron star, or black hole) in orbit with a low-mass (≤ 0.5 M_sol) secondary star, wherein the collapsed star accretes matter from its companion.

The radiation rate is proportional to the square of the density, and the cooling time, which remains in the outer parts too large, becomes smaller than the Hubble time in the core. As a result, the central regions of clusters of galaxies cool down; and since in the center of a cluster gas pressure and gravitational attraction are in equilibrium, the gas density has to rise to maintain the pressure necessary for supporting the outer layers of gas. To cause its density to rise, the cooled gas has to flow inward. As the densest gas, which cools quickest, is already concentrated in the center of the cluster, the inward flow will start at the center, soon followed by the outer layers. This flow of gas is called the cooling flow. Cooling flows are moderated through feedback due to the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the central galaxy. The gas inflow to the center fuels the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The latter then heats again the gas through its radio jets.intracluster-medium, cool-intergalactic-mediumSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2028core-collapse-supernovae (Preliminary)Core-collapse supernovaeA supernova arising from the core collapse of a massive star.supernovaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/304Narrowertype-ii-supernovaetype-ic-supernovaetype-ib-supernovaecoronagraphic-imaging (Preliminary)Coronagraphic imagingdirect-imaging, astronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/313corotating-streams (Preliminary)Corotating streamsinterplanetary-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/314cosmic-abundances (Preliminary)Cosmic abundanceschemical-abundancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/315Related#cosmochemistrycosmic-anisotropy (Preliminary)Cosmic anisotropycosmic-microwave-background-radiationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/316cosmic-background-radiation (Preliminary)Cosmic background radiationrecombination-cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/317Narrowercosmic-microwave-background-radiationcosmic-electrodynamics (Preliminary)Cosmic electrodynamicsplasma-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/318cosmic-inflation (Preliminary)Cosmic inflationA brief exponential expansion of the Universe postulated to have occurred 10-35 seconds after the Big Bang, in response to the separation of the strong interaction from the electroweak interaction.

Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays.

Assuming the existence of dark energy is a way to explain recent observations that the Universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate. Dark energy seems to be a kind of anti-gravity force and is supposed to be related to vacuum energy. Where gravity pulls things together at the more local level, dark energy tears them apart on the grander scale. The acceleration equation, one of Einstein's equations for the homogeneous Universe, indicates that if the Universe is accelerating, the pressure of the driving component should be strongly negative. The first indication of dark energy was provided by the observation of Type Ia supernovae. Other probes of dark energy are: baryon acoustic oscillations, weak gravitational lensing, and clusters of galaxies. In the standard model of cosmology, dark energy currently accounts for almost 74% of the total mass-energy of the Universe. Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant and exotic component such as quintessence.cosmological-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/351Narrowercosmological-constantquintessencedark-interstellar-clouds (Preliminary)Dark interstellar cloudsinterstellar-clouds, nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/352Narrowerinfrared-dark-cloudsbok-globulescometary-globulesdark-matter (Preliminary)Dark matterMatter that has no radiation and therefore cannot be detected directly, but whose presence can be inferred from dynamical phenomena produced by its gravitational influence. The existence of dark matter is deduced mainly from the rotational speeds of galaxies, velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter plays also a central role in cosmic structure formation. There exists a large number of non-baryonic dark matter candidates. They include, the hypothetical stable particles WIMPs, neutralinos, axions, gravitinos, etc. Among unstable candidates are gravitinos with mild R-parity violation and sterile neutrinos.intergalactic-medium, high-energy-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/353Related#particle-astrophysics#cosmology#navarro-frenk-white-profileNarrowerwarm-dark-mattercold-dark-matterbaryonic-dark-matterhot-dark-matterdark-matter-density (Preliminary)Dark matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/354dark-matter-detectors (Preliminary)Dark matter detectorsastronomical-detectorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/355dark-matter-distribution (Preliminary)Dark matter distributionlarge-scale-structure-of-the-universeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/356db-stars (Preliminary)DB starsA white dwarf whose spectrum shows strong He I in the absence of hydrogen or metal lines.helium-rich-stars, white-dwarf-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/358dc-stars (Preliminary)DC starsA white dwarf showing a continuous spectrum with no readily apparent lines.white-dwarf-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/0ddo-classification (Preliminary)DDO classificationgalaxy-classification-systemsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/359ddo-photometry (Preliminary)DDO photometrymedium-band-photometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/360de-excitation-rates (Preliminary)De-excitation ratesatomic-physics, molecular-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2066de-sitter-universe (Preliminary)de Sitter universeA solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity which contains no ordinary matter (Ω_M = 0) or radiation (Ω_R = 0), is Euclidean (k = 0), but has a cosmological constant (Ω_Λ > 0).

Bodies with masses less than Chandrasekhar's limit (1.4 solar masses) are supported by electron degeneracy pressure and have densities of about 10^6 kg/m^3. In collapsed stars of mass above 1.4 solar masses, gravity will overwhelm electron degeneracy and further collapse ensues. Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons, so producing a neutron star. Because neutrons, like electrons, are fermions and therefore subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, at high enough densities, about 10^14 kg/m^3, neutron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse of the star. For masses larger than 2-3 solar masses, even neutron degeneracy cannot prevent further collapse, and a black hole is formed.stellar-remnantsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/367delta-cepheid-variable-stars (Preliminary)Delta Cepheid variable starsThe prototype of classical Cepheid variables, which is a pulsating yellow supergiant. John Goodricke was the first in 1784 to discover its variability. The star shows a quick and sharp rise from minimum to maximum, and slowly declines to its minimum again. The changes in brightness are accompanied by and principally caused by changes in stellar temperature and also by changes in radius. δ Cephei was actually the second Cepheid variable to be discovered. The first one, Eta Aquilae, had been discovered earlier the same year by Edward Pigott. δ Cephei varies with a period of 5.366341 days (or 5 days 8 hours 37.5 minutes) from magnitude 3.48, spectral type F5 Ib in its maximum to magnitude 4.37, spectral type G2 Ib in its minimum.

In diffuse interstellar clouds photoabsorption of the background ultraviolet (UV) radiation field is an important dissociating and ionizing process. Typical densities and temperatures of diffuse clouds are 10^2 to 10^3 cm^-3 and 20 to 100 K respectively.

Their prototype is U Geminorum star. Optically, dwarf nova eruptions have amplitudes of 2-6 mag in V, a duration of a few to 20 days and a recurrence time-scale of weeks to years. Dwarf novae are thought to be semidetached binary stars consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting via Roche lobe overflow from a companion which is usually a late-type, generally main-sequence star. DN outbursts are usually attributed to the release of gravitational energy resulting from an instability in the accretion disk or by sudden mass transfers through the disk.novaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/418Narrowerz-camelopardalis-starswz-sagittae-starssu-ursae-majoris-starssx-arietis-variable-starsu-geminorum-starsdwarf-planets (Preliminary)Dwarf planetsA new category of astronomical objects in the solar system introduced in a resolution by the 26th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on August 24, 2006. The characterizing properties are as follows: 1) It is in orbit around the Sun; 2) It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape; 3) It has not 'cleared the neighbourhood' around its orbit; and 4) It is not a satellite of a planet, or other non-stellar body. The property 3 reclassified Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet because it has not cleared the neighborhood of its orbit (the Kuiper Belt). The largest known dwarf planets are: Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, and 2015 RR245.solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/419Narrowerceresplutodwarf-spheroidal-galaxies (Preliminary)Dwarf spheroidal galaxiesA subtype of dwarf ellipticals (dwarf elliptical galaxy), which are companion to the Milky Way and other similar galaxies. The first example of such objects was discovered by Harlow Shapley (1938) in the constellation Sculptor. 22 such galaxies are known currently to orbit the Milky Way and at least 36 exist in the Local Group of galaxies. Nearby galaxy clusters such as the Virgo, Fornax, Centaurus, and Coma clusters contain hundreds to thousands of individual dSph galaxies. These galaxies have very low surface brightnesses, as low as only 1% that of the sky background. They are also among the smallest, least luminous galaxies known. Most of the radiation from dSph galaxies is emitted by stars in the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The lack of strong emission lines, infrared, or radio emission suggests that these galaxies are generally devoid of interstellar medium. The velocities of stars within dSph galaxies are so high that them must be disrupting. However, the bulk of mass in these galaxies might be undetected. Dynamical models that include dark matter do adequately explain the velocity dispersion of the stars in all dSph systems. In the most extreme cases, only 1% of the mass of the galaxy is visible. Many of the Local Group dSph galaxies show evidence for star formation more recent than 10 Gyr.dwarf-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/420Narrowersagittarius-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxyfornax-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxyursa-minor-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxydwarf-stars (Preliminary)Dwarf starsA star that burns its hydrogen content to produce its energy and therefore belongs to the main-sequence luminosity class.stellar-evolutionary-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2053Related#main-sequence-stars#main-sequenceNarrowerk-dwarf-starsa-dwarf-starst-dwarfsg-dwarf-starsf-dwarf-starso-dwarf-starsm-dwarf-starsb-dwarf-starsdynamical-evolution (Preliminary)Dynamical evolutioncosmological-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/421dynamical-friction (Preliminary)Dynamical frictionThe gravitational interaction between a relatively massive body and a field of much less massive bodies through which the massive body travels.

He found that the bright comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet, and predicted its return for 1758.

When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma, which is later swept into an elongated tail. Reliable measurements of cometary nuclei indicate sizes from a few km to 10 or 20 km. The nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp is one of the largest (perhaps 40 km). The composition of the nucleus is determined by measuring the composition of the coma (except for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko). The dominant volatile is water, followed by carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water) and many other molecules at a lower level.cometsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2160Narrowercomet-surfacescomet-volatilescomet-interiorscomet-origins (Preliminary)Comet originsplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2203Related#cometscomet-surfaces (Preliminary)Comet surfacescomet-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2161comet-tail-streamers (Preliminary)Comet tail streamerscomet-tailsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/273comet-tails (Preliminary)Comet tailsA formation of gas and/or dust that streams away from the coma of many comets under the influence of the Sun's radiation pressure and the solar wind.cometsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/274Narrowercomet-tail-streamerscomet-volatiles (Preliminary)Comet volatilescomet-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2162cometary-globules (Preliminary)Cometary globulesA relatively small cloud of dust and gas in the interstellar medium shaped like a comet with a bright-rimmed head.

Cometary globules are believed to be molecular cloud condensations, which are so dense that they are not disrupted when an H II region expands into the molecular cloud surrounding it. The Rosette nebula is a good example of an H II region which shows an abundance of cometary globules.dark-interstellar-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/276cometary-nebulae (Preliminary)Cometary nebulaeprotostars, nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/278comets (Preliminary)CometsA small body of gas and dust which revolves around the Sun in a usually very elliptical or even parabolic orbit. It is seen to be composed of a head and often with a spectacular gaseous tail extending a great distance from the head. The rocky-icy head is called the comet nucleus. As the comet nears the Sun, the increased temperature causes the ice in the nucleus to sublimate and form a gaseous halo around the nucleus, called the coma. Comets often possess two tails, a dust tail that lies in the orbit behind the comet generated by surface activity, and a brighter, ionized gas tail, that points away from the Sun, driven by solar wind. Cometary reservoirs are thought to represent primordial solar system material. A comet with a dust coating on its surface that inhibits gas production might be classified as an asteroid. Because of this ambiguity, objects such as Chiron, Centaur asteroid, have been reclassified as comets. Comets are primarily composed of amorphous water ice, but also contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water), and many other molecules at a lower level.small-solar-system-bodiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/280Related#aperiodic-comets#astrophysical-masers#interplanetary-medium#comet-dynamics#comet-origins#near-earth-objectsNarrowerlong-period-cometsdirty-snowball-modelcomet-nucleinear-sun-cometsmain-belt-cometscomet-tailscomet-halleycomaeshort-period-cometscommon-envelope-binary-stars (Preliminary)Common envelope binary starsinteracting-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2156Related#common-envelope-evolutioncommon-envelope-evolution (Preliminary)Common envelope evolutionmultiple-star-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2154Related#common-envelope-binary-starscompact-binary-stars (Preliminary)Compact binary starsA binary star system which is composed of a collapsed object (degenerate dwarf, neutron star, or black hole) in orbit with a low-mass (≤ 0.5 M_sol) secondary star, wherein the collapsed star accretes matter from its companion.

The radiation rate is proportional to the square of the density, and the cooling time, which remains in the outer parts too large, becomes smaller than the Hubble time in the core. As a result, the central regions of clusters of galaxies cool down; and since in the center of a cluster gas pressure and gravitational attraction are in equilibrium, the gas density has to rise to maintain the pressure necessary for supporting the outer layers of gas. To cause its density to rise, the cooled gas has to flow inward. As the densest gas, which cools quickest, is already concentrated in the center of the cluster, the inward flow will start at the center, soon followed by the outer layers. This flow of gas is called the cooling flow. Cooling flows are moderated through feedback due to the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the central galaxy. The gas inflow to the center fuels the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The latter then heats again the gas through its radio jets.intracluster-medium, cool-intergalactic-mediumSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2028core-collapse-supernovae (Preliminary)Core-collapse supernovaeA supernova arising from the core collapse of a massive star.supernovaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/304Narrowertype-ii-supernovaetype-ic-supernovaetype-ib-supernovaecoronagraphic-imaging (Preliminary)Coronagraphic imagingdirect-imaging, astronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/313corotating-streams (Preliminary)Corotating streamsinterplanetary-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/314cosmic-abundances (Preliminary)Cosmic abundanceschemical-abundancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/315Related#cosmochemistrycosmic-anisotropy (Preliminary)Cosmic anisotropycosmic-microwave-background-radiationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/316cosmic-background-radiation (Preliminary)Cosmic background radiationrecombination-cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/317Narrowercosmic-microwave-background-radiationcosmic-electrodynamics (Preliminary)Cosmic electrodynamicsplasma-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/318cosmic-inflation (Preliminary)Cosmic inflationA brief exponential expansion of the Universe postulated to have occurred 10-35 seconds after the Big Bang, in response to the separation of the strong interaction from the electroweak interaction.

Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays.

Assuming the existence of dark energy is a way to explain recent observations that the Universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate. Dark energy seems to be a kind of anti-gravity force and is supposed to be related to vacuum energy. Where gravity pulls things together at the more local level, dark energy tears them apart on the grander scale. The acceleration equation, one of Einstein's equations for the homogeneous Universe, indicates that if the Universe is accelerating, the pressure of the driving component should be strongly negative. The first indication of dark energy was provided by the observation of Type Ia supernovae. Other probes of dark energy are: baryon acoustic oscillations, weak gravitational lensing, and clusters of galaxies. In the standard model of cosmology, dark energy currently accounts for almost 74% of the total mass-energy of the Universe. Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant and exotic component such as quintessence.cosmological-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/351Narrowercosmological-constantquintessencedark-interstellar-clouds (Preliminary)Dark interstellar cloudsinterstellar-clouds, nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/352Narrowerinfrared-dark-cloudsbok-globulescometary-globulesdark-matter (Preliminary)Dark matterMatter that has no radiation and therefore cannot be detected directly, but whose presence can be inferred from dynamical phenomena produced by its gravitational influence. The existence of dark matter is deduced mainly from the rotational speeds of galaxies, velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter plays also a central role in cosmic structure formation. There exists a large number of non-baryonic dark matter candidates. They include, the hypothetical stable particles WIMPs, neutralinos, axions, gravitinos, etc. Among unstable candidates are gravitinos with mild R-parity violation and sterile neutrinos.intergalactic-medium, high-energy-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/353Related#particle-astrophysics#cosmology#navarro-frenk-white-profileNarrowerwarm-dark-mattercold-dark-matterbaryonic-dark-matterhot-dark-matterdark-matter-density (Preliminary)Dark matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/354dark-matter-detectors (Preliminary)Dark matter detectorsastronomical-detectorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/355dark-matter-distribution (Preliminary)Dark matter distributionlarge-scale-structure-of-the-universeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/356db-stars (Preliminary)DB starsA white dwarf whose spectrum shows strong He I in the absence of hydrogen or metal lines.helium-rich-stars, white-dwarf-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/358dc-stars (Preliminary)DC starsA white dwarf showing a continuous spectrum with no readily apparent lines.white-dwarf-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/0ddo-classification (Preliminary)DDO classificationgalaxy-classification-systemsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/359ddo-photometry (Preliminary)DDO photometrymedium-band-photometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/360de-excitation-rates (Preliminary)De-excitation ratesatomic-physics, molecular-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2066de-sitter-universe (Preliminary)de Sitter universeA solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity which contains no ordinary matter (Ω_M = 0) or radiation (Ω_R = 0), is Euclidean (k = 0), but has a cosmological constant (Ω_Λ > 0).

Bodies with masses less than Chandrasekhar's limit (1.4 solar masses) are supported by electron degeneracy pressure and have densities of about 10^6 kg/m^3. In collapsed stars of mass above 1.4 solar masses, gravity will overwhelm electron degeneracy and further collapse ensues. Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons, so producing a neutron star. Because neutrons, like electrons, are fermions and therefore subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, at high enough densities, about 10^14 kg/m^3, neutron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse of the star. For masses larger than 2-3 solar masses, even neutron degeneracy cannot prevent further collapse, and a black hole is formed.stellar-remnantsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/367delta-cepheid-variable-stars (Preliminary)Delta Cepheid variable starsThe prototype of classical Cepheid variables, which is a pulsating yellow supergiant. John Goodricke was the first in 1784 to discover its variability. The star shows a quick and sharp rise from minimum to maximum, and slowly declines to its minimum again. The changes in brightness are accompanied by and principally caused by changes in stellar temperature and also by changes in radius. δ Cephei was actually the second Cepheid variable to be discovered. The first one, Eta Aquilae, had been discovered earlier the same year by Edward Pigott. δ Cephei varies with a period of 5.366341 days (or 5 days 8 hours 37.5 minutes) from magnitude 3.48, spectral type F5 Ib in its maximum to magnitude 4.37, spectral type G2 Ib in its minimum.

In diffuse interstellar clouds photoabsorption of the background ultraviolet (UV) radiation field is an important dissociating and ionizing process. Typical densities and temperatures of diffuse clouds are 10^2 to 10^3 cm^-3 and 20 to 100 K respectively.

Their prototype is U Geminorum star. Optically, dwarf nova eruptions have amplitudes of 2-6 mag in V, a duration of a few to 20 days and a recurrence time-scale of weeks to years. Dwarf novae are thought to be semidetached binary stars consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting via Roche lobe overflow from a companion which is usually a late-type, generally main-sequence star. DN outbursts are usually attributed to the release of gravitational energy resulting from an instability in the accretion disk or by sudden mass transfers through the disk.novaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/418Narrowerz-camelopardalis-starswz-sagittae-starssu-ursae-majoris-starssx-arietis-variable-starsu-geminorum-starsdwarf-planets (Preliminary)Dwarf planetsA new category of astronomical objects in the solar system introduced in a resolution by the 26th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on August 24, 2006. The characterizing properties are as follows: 1) It is in orbit around the Sun; 2) It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape; 3) It has not 'cleared the neighbourhood' around its orbit; and 4) It is not a satellite of a planet, or other non-stellar body. The property 3 reclassified Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet because it has not cleared the neighborhood of its orbit (the Kuiper Belt). The largest known dwarf planets are: Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, and 2015 RR245.solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/419Narrowerceresplutodwarf-spheroidal-galaxies (Preliminary)Dwarf spheroidal galaxiesA subtype of dwarf ellipticals (dwarf elliptical galaxy), which are companion to the Milky Way and other similar galaxies. The first example of such objects was discovered by Harlow Shapley (1938) in the constellation Sculptor. 22 such galaxies are known currently to orbit the Milky Way and at least 36 exist in the Local Group of galaxies. Nearby galaxy clusters such as the Virgo, Fornax, Centaurus, and Coma clusters contain hundreds to thousands of individual dSph galaxies. These galaxies have very low surface brightnesses, as low as only 1% that of the sky background. They are also among the smallest, least luminous galaxies known. Most of the radiation from dSph galaxies is emitted by stars in the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The lack of strong emission lines, infrared, or radio emission suggests that these galaxies are generally devoid of interstellar medium. The velocities of stars within dSph galaxies are so high that them must be disrupting. However, the bulk of mass in these galaxies might be undetected. Dynamical models that include dark matter do adequately explain the velocity dispersion of the stars in all dSph systems. In the most extreme cases, only 1% of the mass of the galaxy is visible. Many of the Local Group dSph galaxies show evidence for star formation more recent than 10 Gyr.dwarf-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/420Narrowersagittarius-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxyfornax-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxyursa-minor-dwarf-spheroidal-galaxydwarf-stars (Preliminary)Dwarf starsA star that burns its hydrogen content to produce its energy and therefore belongs to the main-sequence luminosity class.stellar-evolutionary-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2053Related#main-sequence-stars#main-sequenceNarrowerk-dwarf-starsa-dwarf-starst-dwarfsg-dwarf-starsf-dwarf-starso-dwarf-starsm-dwarf-starsb-dwarf-starsdynamical-evolution (Preliminary)Dynamical evolutioncosmological-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/421dynamical-friction (Preliminary)Dynamical frictionThe gravitational interaction between a relatively massive body and a field of much less massive bodies through which the massive body travels.

FR-I,Fanaroff Riley Class I,"Liquid water covers 71% of the surface. Over 5,000 active volcanoes have been registered throughout man's known history. The outer layer of the planet, the lithosphere, is covered with the crust. In the upper mantle and beneath the lithosphere, lies asthenosphere. Convection in the asthenosphere has caused plate tectonics motions and continent drifts. The densest layer of the Earth is its core, about 3000 km to 6400 km beneath the surface, consisting primarily of iron and nickel. This core is believed to be at the origin of the magnetic field, which reaches about 3 x 10^-5 tesla near the equator.

The maximum number of solar and lunar visible eclipses occurring annually is seven; the minimum number is two, both being solar. Solar eclipses take place when the new Moon is close to an orbital node and on the same longitude with the Sun. At that moment either the umbra, antumbra, or the penumbra touches the Earth's surface. For an observer located in the umbra the eclipse is total, while for one placed in the antumbra it is annular. Annular eclipses occur around lunar apogee. An observer situated in the penumbra sees only a partial eclipse. A total or annular eclipse can be seen from a band with a width of 270 km at the most, around which, the much larger partiality zone extends. The Moon's shadow crosses the Earth from west to east at about 3,200 km/h. During total eclipses the Sun's disk is entirely covered and the solar corona can be seen. A solar eclipse can last up to 3h (between the first and the fourth contacts). Totality has a theoretical maximum duration of 7m 31s, but it is usually shorter. A lunar eclipse can be seen from any place on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon; it occurs when the full Moon passes through the central dark shadow of the Earth. The Earth's shadow is much wider than the Moon and this is why the lunar eclipses can last up to four hours (between the first and the fourth contact).syzygySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/442Narrowerlunar-eclipsespartial-eclipsesbaily-s-beadsannular-eclipseszone-of-totalitytotal-eclipsessolar-eclipsesantumbrapenumbraumbraeclipsing-binary-minima-timing-method (Preliminary)Eclipsing binary minima timing methodtiming-variation-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/443eclipsing-binary-stars (Preliminary)Eclipsing binary starsA binary star in which one of the two stars passes in front of the other so that the system's total light periodically fades.

The right ascension is always measured eastward from the vernal equinox, in the units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Declination is the angle between the celestial equator and the position of the star measured along the star's hour circle. It is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the celestial equator. By definition, the vernal equinox is located at right ascension 0h and declination 0°.

Its distance to Jupiter is 670,900 km, or about 9 Jovian radii. Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo (0.67) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K (-150 °C) at the equator and about 50 K (-220 °C) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers.

They divided the sample into two classes using the ratio RFR of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar, to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour in the map. Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I) , Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FR-II). The boundary between the two classes is not very sharp, and there is some overlap in the luminosities of sources classified as FR-I or FR-II on the basis of their structures. The physical cause of the FR-I/II dichotomy probably lies in the type of flow in the radio jets.radio-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/526far-infrared-astronomy (Preliminary)Far infrared astronomyinfrared-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/529Narrowerfar-infrared-interferometryfar-infrared-interferometry (Preliminary)Far infrared interferometrydirect-imaging, far-infrared-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/528fast-fourier-transform (Preliminary)Fast Fourier transformperiod-searchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1958fast-novae (Preliminary)Fast novaenovaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/530fast-solar-wind (Preliminary)Fast solar windsolar-windSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1872few-body-systems (Preliminary)Few-body systemsn-body-problemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/531field-galaxies (Preliminary)Field galaxiesA galaxy that lies in the direction of a cluster of galaxies, but is not a member of the cluster.

G type giant stars (such as Capella) are almost 100-500 K colder than the corresponding main sequence stars. G type supergiants have temperatures of 4,500-5,500 K. The spectrum of early type G stars, such as the Sun (G2), is dominated by ionized lines of calcium (H and K lines, mainly) and neutral metals. In later type G stars the molecular bands of CH molecules and CN molecules become visible. The main sequence and giant stars have masses of ~ 1 solar mass, while the supergiants are of ~ 10 solar masses.

analogous to the solar wind, from a galaxy that has recently undergone a high burst of star formation or has an active galactic nucleus. Galaxy winds are streams of high speed charged particles blowing out of galaxies with speeds of 300 to 3,000 km s^-1. In the case of starbursts, galactic winds are powered by stellar winds driven by massive stars and supernova explosions. Galaxy winds contain a mixture of extremely hot metal-enriched supernova ejecta and cooler entrained gas and dust. Outflowing material has been observed at great distances from galaxies (10 to 100 kpc). In some cases they escape the galaxy potential well and pollute the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. A prominent example is the superwind of the starburst galaxy M82.galaxy-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/626Related#galactic-windsgalilean-satellites (Preliminary)Galilean satellitesThe four largest and brightest satellites of Jupiter, that is: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.jovian-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/627Narrowerganymedeeuropaiogamma-cassiopeiae-stars (Preliminary)Gamma Cassiopeiae starsemission-line-stars, eruptive-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/635gamma-distribution (Preliminary)Gamma distributionastrostatistics-distributionsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1895gamma-doradus-variable-stars (Preliminary)Gamma Doradus variable starspulsating-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2101gamma-ray-astronomy (Preliminary)Gamma-ray astronomyThe study of gamma rays from extraterrestrial sources, especially gamma-ray bursts.astronomical-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/628Related#gamma-ray-sourcesgamma-ray-bursters (Preliminary)Gamma-ray burstersThe object or phenomenon at the origin of a gamma-ray burst.gamma-ray-transient-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1878Related#gamma-ray-burstsgamma-ray-bursts (Preliminary)Gamma-ray burstsAn intense discharge of gamma rays, which range in duration from tenth of a second to tens of seconds and occur from sources widely distributed over the sky. The radio wave afterglow from the burst can last more than a year, making long-term observations of the sources possible. The favored hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a kilonova, in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements.burst-astrophysics, gamma-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/629Related#gamma-ray-transient-sources#gamma-ray-burstersgamma-ray-detectors (Preliminary)Gamma-ray detectorsastronomical-detectorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/630gamma-ray-lines (Preliminary)Gamma-ray linesgamma-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/631gamma-ray-observatories (Preliminary)Gamma-ray observatoriesspace-observatories, observatoriesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/632gamma-ray-sources (Preliminary)Gamma-ray sourcesAn astronomical object that emits gamma rays.astronomical-radiation-sources, gamma-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/633Related#gamma-ray-astronomyNarrowergamma-ray-transient-sourcesgamma-ray-burstssoft-gamma-ray-repeatersgamma-ray-telescopes (Preliminary)Gamma-ray telescopestelescopes, space-telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/634gamma-ray-transient-sources (Preliminary)Gamma-ray transient sourcestransient-sources, gamma-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1853Related#gamma-ray-burstsNarrowergamma-ray-burstersgamma-rays (Preliminary)Gamma-raysAn electromagnetic wave with a typical wavelength less than 10^-2 Å (10^-12 m), corresponding to frequencies above 10^19 Hz and photon energies above 100 keV.particle-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/637Narrowergamma-ray-linesgamma-ray-sourcesganymede (Preliminary)GanymedeThe seventh and largest of Jupiter's known satellites.

Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.gravitation, relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/641Narrowergeodesicsgravitational-wavesgravitational-singularitiesspacetime-metricgravitational-collapsegravitational-lensingevolution-equationeinstein-field-equationsgeneva-photometry (Preliminary)Geneva photometrymedium-band-photometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/642geocentric-orbit (Preliminary)Geocentric orbitorbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/643geocorona (Preliminary)GeocoronaThe outermost part of Earth's atmosphere, a tenuous halo of hydrogen and some helium extending out to perhaps 15 Earth radii, which emits Lyman-alpha radiation when it is bombarded by sunlight.exosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/644geodesics (Preliminary)GeodesicsThe shortest distance between two points in space (or space-time).

There are over 150 globular clusters orbiting our galaxy. Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems, highly concentrated to the center (up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years), with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies, e.g. M87, contain several thousands of them. There are, however, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old (ages of about 10 billion years, at least), there are galaxies, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33, that host much younger globular clusters (ages of a few billion years, or less).star-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/656godel-universe (Preliminary)Gödel universecosmological-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/657gould-belt (Preliminary)Gould Beltmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/658gpu-computing (Preliminary)GPU computingcomputational-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1969gravastars (Preliminary)Gravastarsquantum-gravitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/660gravitation (Preliminary)GravitationThe universal phenomenon of attraction between material bodies.astrophysical-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/661Related#relativity#stellar-physicsNarrowernewtonian-gravitationcelestial-mechanicsgeneral-relativitynon-standard-theories-of-gravitygravitational-collapse (Preliminary)Gravitational collapseCollapse of a mass of material as a result of the mutual gravitational attraction of all its constituents.general-relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/662Narrowerschonberg-chandrasekhar-limitchandrasekhar-limitjeans-massgravitational-deflection (Preliminary)Gravitational deflectiongeodesicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/663gravitational-disruption (Preliminary)Gravitational disruptionnewtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/664Narrowertidal-disruptiongravitational-energy (Preliminary)Gravitational energyThe energy that an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field, especially an object near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant, at about 9.8 m s^-2.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/665gravitational-equilibrium (Preliminary)Gravitational equilibriumThe condition in a celestial body when gravitational forces acting on each point are balanced by some outward pressure, such as radiation pressure or electron degeneracy pressure, so that no vertical motion results.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/666gravitational-fields (Preliminary)Gravitational fieldsThe region of space in which gravitational attraction exists.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/667gravitational-instability (Preliminary)Gravitational instabilityThe process by which fluctuations in an infinite medium of size greater than a certain length scale (the Jeans length) grow by self-gravitation.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/668gravitational-interaction (Preliminary)Gravitational interactionMutual attraction between any two bodies that have mass.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/669Narrowertwo-body-problemorbital-resonancesthree-body-problemtidal-interactiondynamical-frictionn-body-simulationsgravitational-lensing (Preliminary)Gravitational lensingA concentration of matter, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, that bends light rays from a background object, resulting in production of multiple images.

When an object accelerates, it creates ripples in space-time, just like a boat causes ripples in a lake. Gravitational waves are extremely weak even for the most massive objects like supermassive black holes. They had been inferred from observing a binary pulsar in which the components slow down, due to losing energy from emitting gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time on September 14, 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Since then several other events have been detected by LIGO and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).cosmic-inflation, particle-astrophysics, general-relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/678Related#gravitational-wave-detectors#gravitational-wave-astronomyNarrowerpp-wavesgravitational-wave-sourcesgravity-anomaly (Preliminary)Gravity anomalynewtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/679Narrowergreat-attractormascongravity-darkening (Preliminary)Gravity darkeningThe darkening, or brightening, of a region on a star due to localized decrease, or increase, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter (and have higher temperature) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator.stellar-rotationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/680grazing-incidence-telescopes (Preliminary)Grazing incidence telescopestelescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/681great-attractor (Preliminary)Great AttractorA hypothesized large concentration of mass (about 10^16 "
FR-II,"I) , Fanaroff Riley Class II","Liquid water covers 71% of the surface. Over 5,000 active volcanoes have been registered throughout man's known history. The outer layer of the planet, the lithosphere, is covered with the crust. In the upper mantle and beneath the lithosphere, lies asthenosphere. Convection in the asthenosphere has caused plate tectonics motions and continent drifts. The densest layer of the Earth is its core, about 3000 km to 6400 km beneath the surface, consisting primarily of iron and nickel. This core is believed to be at the origin of the magnetic field, which reaches about 3 x 10^-5 tesla near the equator.

The maximum number of solar and lunar visible eclipses occurring annually is seven; the minimum number is two, both being solar. Solar eclipses take place when the new Moon is close to an orbital node and on the same longitude with the Sun. At that moment either the umbra, antumbra, or the penumbra touches the Earth's surface. For an observer located in the umbra the eclipse is total, while for one placed in the antumbra it is annular. Annular eclipses occur around lunar apogee. An observer situated in the penumbra sees only a partial eclipse. A total or annular eclipse can be seen from a band with a width of 270 km at the most, around which, the much larger partiality zone extends. The Moon's shadow crosses the Earth from west to east at about 3,200 km/h. During total eclipses the Sun's disk is entirely covered and the solar corona can be seen. A solar eclipse can last up to 3h (between the first and the fourth contacts). Totality has a theoretical maximum duration of 7m 31s, but it is usually shorter. A lunar eclipse can be seen from any place on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon; it occurs when the full Moon passes through the central dark shadow of the Earth. The Earth's shadow is much wider than the Moon and this is why the lunar eclipses can last up to four hours (between the first and the fourth contact).syzygySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/442Narrowerlunar-eclipsespartial-eclipsesbaily-s-beadsannular-eclipseszone-of-totalitytotal-eclipsessolar-eclipsesantumbrapenumbraumbraeclipsing-binary-minima-timing-method (Preliminary)Eclipsing binary minima timing methodtiming-variation-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/443eclipsing-binary-stars (Preliminary)Eclipsing binary starsA binary star in which one of the two stars passes in front of the other so that the system's total light periodically fades.

Declination is the angle between the celestial equator and the position of the star measured along the star's hour circle. It is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the celestial equator. By definition, the vernal equinox is located at right ascension 0h and declination 0°. Equatorial coordinates change with time due to the precession of the Earth's rotation axis.astronomical-coordinate-systemsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/467Narrowerright-ascensioncelestial-equatorsolsticehour-angleequinoxequatorial-zonecelestial-polescelestial-spheredeclinationequatorial-mounts (Preliminary)Equatorial mountsA telescope mounting consisting of a polar axis pointed toward the celestial pole, and a declination axis supporting the instrument at right angles to the polar axis.telescope-mountsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/468equatorial-zone (Preliminary)Equatorial zoneequatorial-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/469equinox (Preliminary)EquinoxOne of the two points on the celestial sphere where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic, that is when the apparent ecliptic longitude of the Sun is 0° or 180°. At equinox, the length of the day and the night are equal all over the globe. The equinox is not a fixed point; it moves due to precession and nutation. If only precession is considered, we deal with the mean equinox of date.

With a diameter of 3140 km, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Its mass is 4.80 × 10^22 kg, i.e. 1.5 times less massive than Earth Moon. Its distance to Jupiter is 670,900 km, or about 9 Jovian radii. Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo (0.67) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K (-150 °C) at the equator and about 50 K (-220 °C) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. It is now believed that there is an ocean of salty water, up to 100 km deep, flowing under Europa's ice. Europa's ocean is kept liquid due to tidal heating by Jupiter.galilean-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2189evaporating-gaseous-globules (Preliminary)Evaporating gaseous globulesinterstellar-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/478event-horizons (Preliminary)Event horizonsThe surface surrounding a black hole with the property that any light ray emitted inside it cannot escape to the outer space because of the strength of the gravitational field.

They divided the sample into two classes using the ratio RFR of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar, to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour in the map. Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I) , Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FR-II). The boundary between the two classes is not very sharp, and there is some overlap in the luminosities of sources classified as FR-I or FR-II on the basis of their structures. The physical cause of the FR-I/II dichotomy probably lies in the type of flow in the radio jets.radio-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/526far-infrared-astronomy (Preliminary)Far infrared astronomyinfrared-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/529Narrowerfar-infrared-interferometryfar-infrared-interferometry (Preliminary)Far infrared interferometrydirect-imaging, far-infrared-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/528fast-fourier-transform (Preliminary)Fast Fourier transformperiod-searchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1958fast-novae (Preliminary)Fast novaenovaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/530fast-solar-wind (Preliminary)Fast solar windsolar-windSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1872few-body-systems (Preliminary)Few-body systemsn-body-problemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/531field-galaxies (Preliminary)Field galaxiesA galaxy that lies in the direction of a cluster of galaxies, but is not a member of the cluster.

analogous to the solar wind, from a galaxy that has recently undergone a high burst of star formation or has an active galactic nucleus. Galaxy winds are streams of high speed charged particles blowing out of galaxies with speeds of 300 to 3,000 km s^-1. In the case of starbursts, galactic winds are powered by stellar winds driven by massive stars and supernova explosions. Galaxy winds contain a mixture of extremely hot metal-enriched supernova ejecta and cooler entrained gas and dust. Outflowing material has been observed at great distances from galaxies (10 to 100 kpc). In some cases they escape the galaxy potential well and pollute the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. A prominent example is the superwind of the starburst galaxy M82.galaxy-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/626Related#galactic-windsgalilean-satellites (Preliminary)Galilean satellitesThe four largest and brightest satellites of Jupiter, that is: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.jovian-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/627Narrowerganymedeeuropaiogamma-cassiopeiae-stars (Preliminary)Gamma Cassiopeiae starsemission-line-stars, eruptive-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/635gamma-distribution (Preliminary)Gamma distributionastrostatistics-distributionsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1895gamma-doradus-variable-stars (Preliminary)Gamma Doradus variable starspulsating-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2101gamma-ray-astronomy (Preliminary)Gamma-ray astronomyThe study of gamma rays from extraterrestrial sources, especially gamma-ray bursts.astronomical-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/628Related#gamma-ray-sourcesgamma-ray-bursters (Preliminary)Gamma-ray burstersThe object or phenomenon at the origin of a gamma-ray burst.gamma-ray-transient-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1878Related#gamma-ray-burstsgamma-ray-bursts (Preliminary)Gamma-ray burstsAn intense discharge of gamma rays, which range in duration from tenth of a second to tens of seconds and occur from sources widely distributed over the sky. The radio wave afterglow from the burst can last more than a year, making long-term observations of the sources possible. The favored hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a kilonova, in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements.burst-astrophysics, gamma-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/629Related#gamma-ray-transient-sources#gamma-ray-burstersgamma-ray-detectors (Preliminary)Gamma-ray detectorsastronomical-detectorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/630gamma-ray-lines (Preliminary)Gamma-ray linesgamma-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/631gamma-ray-observatories (Preliminary)Gamma-ray observatoriesspace-observatories, observatoriesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/632gamma-ray-sources (Preliminary)Gamma-ray sourcesAn astronomical object that emits gamma rays.astronomical-radiation-sources, gamma-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/633Related#gamma-ray-astronomyNarrowergamma-ray-transient-sourcesgamma-ray-burstssoft-gamma-ray-repeatersgamma-ray-telescopes (Preliminary)Gamma-ray telescopestelescopes, space-telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/634gamma-ray-transient-sources (Preliminary)Gamma-ray transient sourcestransient-sources, gamma-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1853Related#gamma-ray-burstsNarrowergamma-ray-burstersgamma-rays (Preliminary)Gamma-raysAn electromagnetic wave with a typical wavelength less than 10^-2 Å (10^-12 m), corresponding to frequencies above 10^19 Hz and photon energies above 100 keV.particle-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/637Narrowergamma-ray-linesgamma-ray-sourcesganymede (Preliminary)GanymedeThe seventh and largest of Jupiter's known satellites.

Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.gravitation, relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/641Narrowergeodesicsgravitational-wavesgravitational-singularitiesspacetime-metricgravitational-collapsegravitational-lensingevolution-equationeinstein-field-equationsgeneva-photometry (Preliminary)Geneva photometrymedium-band-photometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/642geocentric-orbit (Preliminary)Geocentric orbitorbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/643geocorona (Preliminary)GeocoronaThe outermost part of Earth's atmosphere, a tenuous halo of hydrogen and some helium extending out to perhaps 15 Earth radii, which emits Lyman-alpha radiation when it is bombarded by sunlight.exosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/644geodesics (Preliminary)GeodesicsThe shortest distance between two points in space (or space-time).

There are over 150 globular clusters orbiting our galaxy. Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems, highly concentrated to the center (up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years), with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies, e.g. M87, contain several thousands of them. There are, however, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old (ages of about 10 billion years, at least), there are galaxies, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33, that host much younger globular clusters (ages of a few billion years, or less).star-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/656godel-universe (Preliminary)Gödel universecosmological-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/657gould-belt (Preliminary)Gould Beltmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/658gpu-computing (Preliminary)GPU computingcomputational-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1969gravastars (Preliminary)Gravastarsquantum-gravitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/660gravitation (Preliminary)GravitationThe universal phenomenon of attraction between material bodies.astrophysical-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/661Related#relativity#stellar-physicsNarrowernewtonian-gravitationcelestial-mechanicsgeneral-relativitynon-standard-theories-of-gravitygravitational-collapse (Preliminary)Gravitational collapseCollapse of a mass of material as a result of the mutual gravitational attraction of all its constituents.general-relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/662Narrowerschonberg-chandrasekhar-limitchandrasekhar-limitjeans-massgravitational-deflection (Preliminary)Gravitational deflectiongeodesicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/663gravitational-disruption (Preliminary)Gravitational disruptionnewtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/664Narrowertidal-disruptiongravitational-energy (Preliminary)Gravitational energyThe energy that an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field, especially an object near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant, at about 9.8 m s^-2.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/665gravitational-equilibrium (Preliminary)Gravitational equilibriumThe condition in a celestial body when gravitational forces acting on each point are balanced by some outward pressure, such as radiation pressure or electron degeneracy pressure, so that no vertical motion results.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/666gravitational-fields (Preliminary)Gravitational fieldsThe region of space in which gravitational attraction exists.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/667gravitational-instability (Preliminary)Gravitational instabilityThe process by which fluctuations in an infinite medium of size greater than a certain length scale (the Jeans length) grow by self-gravitation.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/668gravitational-interaction (Preliminary)Gravitational interactionMutual attraction between any two bodies that have mass.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/669Narrowertwo-body-problemorbital-resonancesthree-body-problemtidal-interactiondynamical-frictionn-body-simulationsgravitational-lensing (Preliminary)Gravitational lensingA concentration of matter, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, that bends light rays from a background object, resulting in production of multiple images.

When an object accelerates, it creates ripples in space-time, just like a boat causes ripples in a lake. Gravitational waves are extremely weak even for the most massive objects like supermassive black holes. They had been inferred from observing a binary pulsar in which the components slow down, due to losing energy from emitting gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time on September 14, 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Since then several other events have been detected by LIGO and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).cosmic-inflation, particle-astrophysics, general-relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/678Related#gravitational-wave-detectors#gravitational-wave-astronomyNarrowerpp-wavesgravitational-wave-sourcesgravity-anomaly (Preliminary)Gravity anomalynewtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/679Narrowergreat-attractormascongravity-darkening (Preliminary)Gravity darkeningThe darkening, or brightening, of a region on a star due to localized decrease, or increase, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter (and have higher temperature) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator.stellar-rotationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/680grazing-incidence-telescopes (Preliminary)Grazing incidence telescopestelescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/681great-attractor (Preliminary)Great AttractorA hypothesized large concentration of mass (about 10^16 "
LIGO,Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory,"Liquid water covers 71% of the surface. Over 5,000 active volcanoes have been registered throughout man's known history. The outer layer of the planet, the lithosphere, is covered with the crust. In the upper mantle and beneath the lithosphere, lies asthenosphere. Convection in the asthenosphere has caused plate tectonics motions and continent drifts. The densest layer of the Earth is its core, about 3000 km to 6400 km beneath the surface, consisting primarily of iron and nickel. This core is believed to be at the origin of the magnetic field, which reaches about 3 x 10^-5 tesla near the equator. It has only one natural satellite, the Moon.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/439Related#the-moonearth-trojans (Preliminary)Earth trojanstrojan-asteroids, near-earth-objectsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/438eccentric-anomaly (Preliminary)Eccentric anomalyOf a planetary orbit, the angle measured from the perihelion position, to the center of the circumscribing auxiliary circle, to the projected position of the planet on the circle.orbital-anomaliesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/440eccentricity (Preliminary)EccentricityThe amount by which the orbit deviates from circularity: e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to a focus and a the semi-major axis. If e = 0, the orbit is a circle. If e < 1, the orbit is an ellipse, if e > 1 it is a hyperbola, and if e = 1 it is a parabola. The eccentricity is one of the six orbital elements that define a Keplerian orbit.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/441eclipses (Preliminary)EclipsesThe passage of the shadow of a celestial body over the surface of another. The maximum number of solar and lunar visible eclipses occurring annually is seven; the minimum number is two, both being solar. Solar eclipses take place when the new Moon is close to an orbital node and on the same longitude with the Sun. At that moment either the umbra, antumbra, or the penumbra touches the Earth's surface. For an observer located in the umbra the eclipse is total, while for one placed in the antumbra it is annular. Annular eclipses occur around lunar apogee. An observer situated in the penumbra sees only a partial eclipse. A total or annular eclipse can be seen from a band with a width of 270 km at the most, around which, the much larger partiality zone extends. The Moon's shadow crosses the Earth from west to east at about 3,200 km/h. During total eclipses the Sun's disk is entirely covered and the solar corona can be seen. A solar eclipse can last up to 3h (between the first and the fourth contacts). Totality has a theoretical maximum duration of 7m 31s, but it is usually shorter. A lunar eclipse can be seen from any place on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon; it occurs when the full Moon passes through the central dark shadow of the Earth. The Earth's shadow is much wider than the Moon and this is why the lunar eclipses can last up to four hours (between the first and the fourth contact).syzygySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/442Narrowerlunar-eclipsespartial-eclipsesbaily-s-beadsannular-eclipseszone-of-totalitytotal-eclipsessolar-eclipsesantumbrapenumbraumbraeclipsing-binary-minima-timing-method (Preliminary)Eclipsing binary minima timing methodtiming-variation-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/443eclipsing-binary-stars (Preliminary)Eclipsing binary starsA binary star in which one of the two stars passes in front of the other so that the system's total light periodically fades.

The system consists of two components, right ascension and declination. Right ascension is the angle between the vernal equinox and the point where the hour circle intersects the celestial equator. The right ascension is always measured eastward from the vernal equinox, in the units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Declination is the angle between the celestial equator and the position of the star measured along the star's hour circle. It is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the celestial equator. By definition, the vernal equinox is located at right ascension 0h and declination 0°. Equatorial coordinates change with time due to the precession of the Earth's rotation axis.astronomical-coordinate-systemsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/467Narrowerright-ascensioncelestial-equatorsolsticehour-angleequinoxequatorial-zonecelestial-polescelestial-spheredeclinationequatorial-mounts (Preliminary)Equatorial mountsA telescope mounting consisting of a polar axis pointed toward the celestial pole, and a declination axis supporting the instrument at right angles to the polar axis.telescope-mountsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/468equatorial-zone (Preliminary)Equatorial zoneequatorial-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/469equinox (Preliminary)EquinoxOne of the two points on the celestial sphere where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic, that is when the apparent ecliptic longitude of the Sun is 0° or 180°.

With a diameter of 3140 km, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Its mass is 4.80 × 10^22 kg, i.e. 1.5 times less massive than Earth Moon. Its distance to Jupiter is 670,900 km, or about 9 Jovian radii. Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo (0.67) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K (-150 °C) at the equator and about 50 K (-220 °C) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. It is now believed that there is an ocean of salty water, up to 100 km deep, flowing under Europa's ice. Europa's ocean is kept liquid due to tidal heating by Jupiter.galilean-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2189evaporating-gaseous-globules (Preliminary)Evaporating gaseous globulesinterstellar-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/478event-horizons (Preliminary)Event horizonsThe surface surrounding a black hole with the property that any light ray emitted inside it cannot escape to the outer space because of the strength of the gravitational field.

They divided the sample into two classes using the ratio RFR of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar, to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour in the map. Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I) , Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FR-II). The boundary between the two classes is not very sharp, and there is some overlap in the luminosities of sources classified as FR-I or FR-II on the basis of their structures. The physical cause of the FR-I/II dichotomy probably lies in the type of flow in the radio jets.radio-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/526far-infrared-astronomy (Preliminary)Far infrared astronomyinfrared-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/529Narrowerfar-infrared-interferometryfar-infrared-interferometry (Preliminary)Far infrared interferometrydirect-imaging, far-infrared-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/528fast-fourier-transform (Preliminary)Fast Fourier transformperiod-searchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1958fast-novae (Preliminary)Fast novaenovaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/530fast-solar-wind (Preliminary)Fast solar windsolar-windSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1872few-body-systems (Preliminary)Few-body systemsn-body-problemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/531field-galaxies (Preliminary)Field galaxiesA galaxy that lies in the direction of a cluster of galaxies, but is not a member of the cluster.

The spectrum of early type G stars, such as the Sun (G2), is dominated by ionized lines of calcium (H and K lines, mainly) and neutral metals. In later type G stars the molecular bands of CH molecules and CN molecules become visible. The main sequence and giant stars have masses of ~ 1 solar mass, while the supergiants are of ~ 10 solar masses.

analogous to the solar wind, from a galaxy that has recently undergone a high burst of star formation or has an active galactic nucleus. Galaxy winds are streams of high speed charged particles blowing out of galaxies with speeds of 300 to 3,000 km s^-1. In the case of starbursts, galactic winds are powered by stellar winds driven by massive stars and supernova explosions. Galaxy winds contain a mixture of extremely hot metal-enriched supernova ejecta and cooler entrained gas and dust. Outflowing material has been observed at great distances from galaxies (10 to 100 kpc). In some cases they escape the galaxy potential well and pollute the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. A prominent example is the superwind of the starburst galaxy M82.galaxy-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/626Related#galactic-windsgalilean-satellites (Preliminary)Galilean satellitesThe four largest and brightest satellites of Jupiter, that is: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.jovian-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/627Narrowerganymedeeuropaiogamma-cassiopeiae-stars (Preliminary)Gamma Cassiopeiae starsemission-line-stars, eruptive-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/635gamma-distribution (Preliminary)Gamma distributionastrostatistics-distributionsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1895gamma-doradus-variable-stars (Preliminary)Gamma Doradus variable starspulsating-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2101gamma-ray-astronomy (Preliminary)Gamma-ray astronomyThe study of gamma rays from extraterrestrial sources, especially gamma-ray bursts.astronomical-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/628Related#gamma-ray-sourcesgamma-ray-bursters (Preliminary)Gamma-ray burstersThe object or phenomenon at the origin of a gamma-ray burst.gamma-ray-transient-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1878Related#gamma-ray-burstsgamma-ray-bursts (Preliminary)Gamma-ray burstsAn intense discharge of gamma rays, which range in duration from tenth of a second to tens of seconds and occur from sources widely distributed over the sky. The radio wave afterglow from the burst can last more than a year, making long-term observations of the sources possible. The favored hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a kilonova, in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements.burst-astrophysics, gamma-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/629Related#gamma-ray-transient-sources#gamma-ray-burstersgamma-ray-detectors (Preliminary)Gamma-ray detectorsastronomical-detectorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/630gamma-ray-lines (Preliminary)Gamma-ray linesgamma-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/631gamma-ray-observatories (Preliminary)Gamma-ray observatoriesspace-observatories, observatoriesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/632gamma-ray-sources (Preliminary)Gamma-ray sourcesAn astronomical object that emits gamma rays.astronomical-radiation-sources, gamma-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/633Related#gamma-ray-astronomyNarrowergamma-ray-transient-sourcesgamma-ray-burstssoft-gamma-ray-repeatersgamma-ray-telescopes (Preliminary)Gamma-ray telescopestelescopes, space-telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/634gamma-ray-transient-sources (Preliminary)Gamma-ray transient sourcestransient-sources, gamma-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1853Related#gamma-ray-burstsNarrowergamma-ray-burstersgamma-rays (Preliminary)Gamma-raysAn electromagnetic wave with a typical wavelength less than 10^-2 Å (10^-12 m), corresponding to frequencies above 10^19 Hz and photon energies above 100 keV.particle-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/637Narrowergamma-ray-linesgamma-ray-sourcesganymede (Preliminary)GanymedeThe seventh and largest of Jupiter's known satellites.

Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.gravitation, relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/641Narrowergeodesicsgravitational-wavesgravitational-singularitiesspacetime-metricgravitational-collapsegravitational-lensingevolution-equationeinstein-field-equationsgeneva-photometry (Preliminary)Geneva photometrymedium-band-photometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/642geocentric-orbit (Preliminary)Geocentric orbitorbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/643geocorona (Preliminary)GeocoronaThe outermost part of Earth's atmosphere, a tenuous halo of hydrogen and some helium extending out to perhaps 15 Earth radii, which emits Lyman-alpha radiation when it is bombarded by sunlight.exosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/644geodesics (Preliminary)GeodesicsThe shortest distance between two points in space (or space-time).

There are over 150 globular clusters orbiting our galaxy. Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems, highly concentrated to the center (up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years), with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies, e.g. M87, contain several thousands of them. There are, however, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old (ages of about 10 billion years, at least), there are galaxies, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33, that host much younger globular clusters (ages of a few billion years, or less).star-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/656godel-universe (Preliminary)Gödel universecosmological-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/657gould-belt (Preliminary)Gould Beltmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/658gpu-computing (Preliminary)GPU computingcomputational-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1969gravastars (Preliminary)Gravastarsquantum-gravitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/660gravitation (Preliminary)GravitationThe universal phenomenon of attraction between material bodies.astrophysical-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/661Related#relativity#stellar-physicsNarrowernewtonian-gravitationcelestial-mechanicsgeneral-relativitynon-standard-theories-of-gravitygravitational-collapse (Preliminary)Gravitational collapseCollapse of a mass of material as a result of the mutual gravitational attraction of all its constituents.general-relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/662Narrowerschonberg-chandrasekhar-limitchandrasekhar-limitjeans-massgravitational-deflection (Preliminary)Gravitational deflectiongeodesicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/663gravitational-disruption (Preliminary)Gravitational disruptionnewtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/664Narrowertidal-disruptiongravitational-energy (Preliminary)Gravitational energyThe energy that an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field, especially an object near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant, at about 9.8 m s^-2.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/665gravitational-equilibrium (Preliminary)Gravitational equilibriumThe condition in a celestial body when gravitational forces acting on each point are balanced by some outward pressure, such as radiation pressure or electron degeneracy pressure, so that no vertical motion results.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/666gravitational-fields (Preliminary)Gravitational fieldsThe region of space in which gravitational attraction exists.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/667gravitational-instability (Preliminary)Gravitational instabilityThe process by which fluctuations in an infinite medium of size greater than a certain length scale (the Jeans length) grow by self-gravitation.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/668gravitational-interaction (Preliminary)Gravitational interactionMutual attraction between any two bodies that have mass.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/669Narrowertwo-body-problemorbital-resonancesthree-body-problemtidal-interactiondynamical-frictionn-body-simulationsgravitational-lensing (Preliminary)Gravitational lensingA concentration of matter, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, that bends light rays from a background object, resulting in production of multiple images.

When an object accelerates, it creates ripples in space-time, just like a boat causes ripples in a lake. Gravitational waves are extremely weak even for the most massive objects like supermassive black holes. They had been inferred from observing a binary pulsar in which the components slow down, due to losing energy from emitting gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time on September 14, 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Since then several other events have been detected by LIGO and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).cosmic-inflation, particle-astrophysics, general-relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/678Related#gravitational-wave-detectors#gravitational-wave-astronomyNarrowerpp-wavesgravitational-wave-sourcesgravity-anomaly (Preliminary)Gravity anomalynewtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/679Narrowergreat-attractormascongravity-darkening (Preliminary)Gravity darkeningThe darkening, or brightening, of a region on a star due to localized decrease, or increase, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter (and have higher temperature) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator.stellar-rotationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/680grazing-incidence-telescopes (Preliminary)Grazing incidence telescopestelescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/681great-attractor (Preliminary)Great AttractorA hypothesized large concentration of mass (about 10^16 "
LISA,Laser Interferometer Space Antenna,"Liquid water covers 71% of the surface. Over 5,000 active volcanoes have been registered throughout man's known history. The outer layer of the planet, the lithosphere, is covered with the crust. In the upper mantle and beneath the lithosphere, lies asthenosphere. Convection in the asthenosphere has caused plate tectonics motions and continent drifts. The densest layer of the Earth is its core, about 3000 km to 6400 km beneath the surface, consisting primarily of iron and nickel. This core is believed to be at the origin of the magnetic field, which reaches about 3 x 10^-5 tesla near the equator. It has only one natural satellite, the Moon.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/439Related#the-moonearth-trojans (Preliminary)Earth trojanstrojan-asteroids, near-earth-objectsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/438eccentric-anomaly (Preliminary)Eccentric anomalyOf a planetary orbit, the angle measured from the perihelion position, to the center of the circumscribing auxiliary circle, to the projected position of the planet on the circle.orbital-anomaliesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/440eccentricity (Preliminary)EccentricityThe amount by which the orbit deviates from circularity: e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to a focus and a the semi-major axis. If e = 0, the orbit is a circle. If e < 1, the orbit is an ellipse, if e > 1 it is a hyperbola, and if e = 1 it is a parabola. The eccentricity is one of the six orbital elements that define a Keplerian orbit.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/441eclipses (Preliminary)EclipsesThe passage of the shadow of a celestial body over the surface of another. The maximum number of solar and lunar visible eclipses occurring annually is seven; the minimum number is two, both being solar. Solar eclipses take place when the new Moon is close to an orbital node and on the same longitude with the Sun. At that moment either the umbra, antumbra, or the penumbra touches the Earth's surface. For an observer located in the umbra the eclipse is total, while for one placed in the antumbra it is annular. Annular eclipses occur around lunar apogee. An observer situated in the penumbra sees only a partial eclipse. A total or annular eclipse can be seen from a band with a width of 270 km at the most, around which, the much larger partiality zone extends. The Moon's shadow crosses the Earth from west to east at about 3,200 km/h. During total eclipses the Sun's disk is entirely covered and the solar corona can be seen. A solar eclipse can last up to 3h (between the first and the fourth contacts). Totality has a theoretical maximum duration of 7m 31s, but it is usually shorter. A lunar eclipse can be seen from any place on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon; it occurs when the full Moon passes through the central dark shadow of the Earth. The Earth's shadow is much wider than the Moon and this is why the lunar eclipses can last up to four hours (between the first and the fourth contact).syzygySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/442Narrowerlunar-eclipsespartial-eclipsesbaily-s-beadsannular-eclipseszone-of-totalitytotal-eclipsessolar-eclipsesantumbrapenumbraumbraeclipsing-binary-minima-timing-method (Preliminary)Eclipsing binary minima timing methodtiming-variation-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/443eclipsing-binary-stars (Preliminary)Eclipsing binary starsA binary star in which one of the two stars passes in front of the other so that the system's total light periodically fades.

The system consists of two components, right ascension and declination. Right ascension is the angle between the vernal equinox and the point where the hour circle intersects the celestial equator. The right ascension is always measured eastward from the vernal equinox, in the units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Declination is the angle between the celestial equator and the position of the star measured along the star's hour circle. It is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the celestial equator. By definition, the vernal equinox is located at right ascension 0h and declination 0°. Equatorial coordinates change with time due to the precession of the Earth's rotation axis.astronomical-coordinate-systemsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/467Narrowerright-ascensioncelestial-equatorsolsticehour-angleequinoxequatorial-zonecelestial-polescelestial-spheredeclinationequatorial-mounts (Preliminary)Equatorial mountsA telescope mounting consisting of a polar axis pointed toward the celestial pole, and a declination axis supporting the instrument at right angles to the polar axis.telescope-mountsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/468equatorial-zone (Preliminary)Equatorial zoneequatorial-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/469equinox (Preliminary)EquinoxOne of the two points on the celestial sphere where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic, that is when the apparent ecliptic longitude of the Sun is 0° or 180°.

With a diameter of 3140 km, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Its mass is 4.80 × 10^22 kg, i.e. 1.5 times less massive than Earth Moon. Its distance to Jupiter is 670,900 km, or about 9 Jovian radii. Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo (0.67) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K (-150 °C) at the equator and about 50 K (-220 °C) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. It is now believed that there is an ocean of salty water, up to 100 km deep, flowing under Europa's ice.

They divided the sample into two classes using the ratio RFR of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar, to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour in the map. Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I) , Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FR-II). The boundary between the two classes is not very sharp, and there is some overlap in the luminosities of sources classified as FR-I or FR-II on the basis of their structures.

The G-type stars on the main sequence have surface temperatures of 5,300-6,000 K and therefore appear yellow in color. G type giant stars (such as Capella) are almost 100-500 K colder than the corresponding main sequence stars. G type supergiants have temperatures of 4,500-5,500 K. The spectrum of early type G stars, such as the Sun (G2), is dominated by ionized lines of calcium (H and K lines, mainly) and neutral metals. In later type G stars the molecular bands of CH molecules and CN molecules become visible. The main sequence and giant stars have masses of ~ 1 solar mass, while the supergiants are of ~ 10 solar masses.

analogous to the solar wind, from a galaxy that has recently undergone a high burst of star formation or has an active galactic nucleus. Galaxy winds are streams of high speed charged particles blowing out of galaxies with speeds of 300 to 3,000 km s^-1. In the case of starbursts, galactic winds are powered by stellar winds driven by massive stars and supernova explosions. Galaxy winds contain a mixture of extremely hot metal-enriched supernova ejecta and cooler entrained gas and dust. Outflowing material has been observed at great distances from galaxies (10 to 100 kpc). In some cases they escape the galaxy potential well and pollute the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. A prominent example is the superwind of the starburst galaxy M82.galaxy-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/626Related#galactic-windsgalilean-satellites (Preliminary)Galilean satellitesThe four largest and brightest satellites of Jupiter, that is: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.jovian-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/627Narrowerganymedeeuropaiogamma-cassiopeiae-stars (Preliminary)Gamma Cassiopeiae starsemission-line-stars, eruptive-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/635gamma-distribution (Preliminary)Gamma distributionastrostatistics-distributionsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1895gamma-doradus-variable-stars (Preliminary)Gamma Doradus variable starspulsating-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2101gamma-ray-astronomy (Preliminary)Gamma-ray astronomyThe study of gamma rays from extraterrestrial sources, especially gamma-ray bursts.astronomical-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/628Related#gamma-ray-sourcesgamma-ray-bursters (Preliminary)Gamma-ray burstersThe object or phenomenon at the origin of a gamma-ray burst.gamma-ray-transient-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1878Related#gamma-ray-burstsgamma-ray-bursts (Preliminary)Gamma-ray burstsAn intense discharge of gamma rays, which range in duration from tenth of a second to tens of seconds and occur from sources widely distributed over the sky. The radio wave afterglow from the burst can last more than a year, making long-term observations of the sources possible. The favored hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a kilonova, in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements.burst-astrophysics, gamma-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/629Related#gamma-ray-transient-sources#gamma-ray-burstersgamma-ray-detectors (Preliminary)Gamma-ray detectorsastronomical-detectorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/630gamma-ray-lines (Preliminary)Gamma-ray linesgamma-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/631gamma-ray-observatories (Preliminary)Gamma-ray observatoriesspace-observatories, observatoriesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/632gamma-ray-sources (Preliminary)Gamma-ray sourcesAn astronomical object that emits gamma rays.astronomical-radiation-sources, gamma-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/633Related#gamma-ray-astronomyNarrowergamma-ray-transient-sourcesgamma-ray-burstssoft-gamma-ray-repeatersgamma-ray-telescopes (Preliminary)Gamma-ray telescopestelescopes, space-telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/634gamma-ray-transient-sources (Preliminary)Gamma-ray transient sourcestransient-sources, gamma-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1853Related#gamma-ray-burstsNarrowergamma-ray-burstersgamma-rays (Preliminary)Gamma-raysAn electromagnetic wave with a typical wavelength less than 10^-2 Å (10^-12 m), corresponding to frequencies above 10^19 Hz and photon energies above 100 keV.particle-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/637Narrowergamma-ray-linesgamma-ray-sourcesganymede (Preliminary)GanymedeThe seventh and largest of Jupiter's known satellites.

Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.gravitation, relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/641Narrowergeodesicsgravitational-wavesgravitational-singularitiesspacetime-metricgravitational-collapsegravitational-lensingevolution-equationeinstein-field-equationsgeneva-photometry (Preliminary)Geneva photometrymedium-band-photometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/642geocentric-orbit (Preliminary)Geocentric orbitorbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/643geocorona (Preliminary)GeocoronaThe outermost part of Earth's atmosphere, a tenuous halo of hydrogen and some helium extending out to perhaps 15 Earth radii, which emits Lyman-alpha radiation when it is bombarded by sunlight.exosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/644geodesics (Preliminary)GeodesicsThe shortest distance between two points in space (or space-time).

There are over 150 globular clusters orbiting our galaxy. Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems, highly concentrated to the center (up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years), with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies, e.g. M87, contain several thousands of them. There are, however, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old (ages of about 10 billion years, at least), there are galaxies, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33, that host much younger globular clusters (ages of a few billion years, or less).star-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/656godel-universe (Preliminary)Gödel universecosmological-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/657gould-belt (Preliminary)Gould Beltmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/658gpu-computing (Preliminary)GPU computingcomputational-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1969gravastars (Preliminary)Gravastarsquantum-gravitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/660gravitation (Preliminary)GravitationThe universal phenomenon of attraction between material bodies.astrophysical-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/661Related#relativity#stellar-physicsNarrowernewtonian-gravitationcelestial-mechanicsgeneral-relativitynon-standard-theories-of-gravitygravitational-collapse (Preliminary)Gravitational collapseCollapse of a mass of material as a result of the mutual gravitational attraction of all its constituents.general-relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/662Narrowerschonberg-chandrasekhar-limitchandrasekhar-limitjeans-massgravitational-deflection (Preliminary)Gravitational deflectiongeodesicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/663gravitational-disruption (Preliminary)Gravitational disruptionnewtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/664Narrowertidal-disruptiongravitational-energy (Preliminary)Gravitational energyThe energy that an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field, especially an object near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant, at about 9.8 m s^-2.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/665gravitational-equilibrium (Preliminary)Gravitational equilibriumThe condition in a celestial body when gravitational forces acting on each point are balanced by some outward pressure, such as radiation pressure or electron degeneracy pressure, so that no vertical motion results.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/666gravitational-fields (Preliminary)Gravitational fieldsThe region of space in which gravitational attraction exists.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/667gravitational-instability (Preliminary)Gravitational instabilityThe process by which fluctuations in an infinite medium of size greater than a certain length scale (the Jeans length) grow by self-gravitation.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/668gravitational-interaction (Preliminary)Gravitational interactionMutual attraction between any two bodies that have mass.newtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/669Narrowertwo-body-problemorbital-resonancesthree-body-problemtidal-interactiondynamical-frictionn-body-simulationsgravitational-lensing (Preliminary)Gravitational lensingA concentration of matter, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, that bends light rays from a background object, resulting in production of multiple images.

When an object accelerates, it creates ripples in space-time, just like a boat causes ripples in a lake. Gravitational waves are extremely weak even for the most massive objects like supermassive black holes. They had been inferred from observing a binary pulsar in which the components slow down, due to losing energy from emitting gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time on September 14, 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Since then several other events have been detected by LIGO and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).cosmic-inflation, particle-astrophysics, general-relativitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/678Related#gravitational-wave-detectors#gravitational-wave-astronomyNarrowerpp-wavesgravitational-wave-sourcesgravity-anomaly (Preliminary)Gravity anomalynewtonian-gravitationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/679Narrowergreat-attractormascongravity-darkening (Preliminary)Gravity darkeningThe darkening, or brightening, of a region on a star due to localized decrease, or increase, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter (and have higher temperature) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator.stellar-rotationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/680grazing-incidence-telescopes (Preliminary)Grazing incidence telescopestelescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/681great-attractor (Preliminary)Great AttractorA hypothesized large concentration of mass (about 10^16 "

The temperature is plotted in the inverse direction, with high temperatures on the left and low temperatures on the right. On the diagram the majority of stars are concentrated in a diagonal strip running from upper left to lower right, i.e. from high temperature-high luminosity massive stars to low temperature-low luminosity low-mass stars. This feature is known as the main sequence. This is the locus of stars burning hydrogen in their cores (proton-proton chain). The lower edge of this strip, known as the zero age main sequence (ZAMS), designates the positions where stars of different mass first begin to burn hydrogen in their cores. Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that, despite being very hot, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core. They are no longer generating energy but are merely emitting light as they cool (white dwarf cooling track). Stars with high luminosities but relatively low temperatures occupy a wide region above the main sequence. The majority of them have used up all the hydrogen in their cores and have expanded and cooled as a result of internal readjustment. Called red giants, they are still burning helium in their cores (helium burning, carbon burning). There are also stars with very high luminosities, resulting from their enormous outputs of energy, because they are burning their fuel at a prodigious rate. These are the supergiants. They can be hot or cool, hence blue or red in color.stellar-evolutionary-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/725Related#zero-age-horizontal-branch-stars#zero-age-main-sequence-stars#hayashi-track#henyey-track#evolved-stars#stellar-evolutionary-types#stellar-physicsNarrowerpre-main-sequenceasymptotic-giant-branchturnoff-pointinstability-strippost-asymptotic-giant-branchblue-loopgiant-branchmain-sequencehertzsprung-gaphorizontal-branchheterodyne-interferometry (Preliminary)Heterodyne interferometryinterferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/726heterodyne-receivers (Preliminary)Heterodyne receiversradio-telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/727hi-shells (Preliminary)HI shellsh-i-regionsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/728hickson-compact-group (Preliminary)Hickson compact groupgalaxy-groupsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/729hierarchical-cosmology (Preliminary)Hierarchical cosmologyA cosmology characterized by clustering of galaxy clusters in increasingly larger systems.cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/730hierarchical-models (Preliminary)Hierarchical modelsbayesian-statisticsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1925high-altitude-balloons (Preliminary)High altitude balloonsastronomical-instrumentationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/738high-angular-resolution (Preliminary)High angular resolutionastronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2167high-energy-astrophysics (Preliminary)High energy astrophysicsA branch of astrophysics that deals with objects emitting highly energetic radiation, such as X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, and extreme ultraviolet astronomy, as well as neutrinos and cosmic rays.Same Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/739Narroweractive-galactic-nucleiblack-holeswarm-hot-intergalactic-mediumblack-hole-physicsdark-mattertransient-sourcesjetsplasma-astrophysicsseyfert-galaxiesparticle-astrophysicsburst-astrophysicsintracluster-mediumneutrino-astronomyrelativistic-binary-starshigh-energy-cosmic-radiation (Preliminary)High-energy cosmic radiationcosmic-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/731high-latitude-field (Preliminary)High latitude fieldfield-of-viewSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/737high-luminosity-active-galactic-nuclei (Preliminary)High-luminosity active galactic nucleiactive-galactic-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2034high-mass-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)High mass x-ray binary starsA member of one of the two main classes of X-ray binary systems where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole and the other one a massive star.

It displays a stage of stellar evolution which immediately follows the red giant branch (RGB) in stars with an initial mass < 1.2 M_sun. When the star's ascent of the RGB is terminated by the helium flash, it moves down to the Horizontal Branch (HB). The star's effective temperature on the HB is higher than it was on the RGB, but the luminosity is considerably less than at the helium flash. Usually HB stars have two energy sources: in addition to the helium burning in their cores, they experience hydrogen fusion in a surrounding shell. The thickness of the shell determines the color of the HB stars. A thin shell, involving low opacity, makes the star look blue. The HB domain encompasses a very large effective temperature range with several members: extreme HB, blue HB, RR Lyrae, red HB, and red clump stars. The locations depend on many parameters, including stellar mass, metallicity, age, helium abundance, and rotation.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2048Related#zero-age-horizontal-branch-stars#horizontal-branch-stars#extreme-horizontal-branch-starshorizontal-branch-stars (Preliminary)Horizontal branch starsA star lying on the horizontal branch.stellar-evolutionary-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/746Related#horizontal-branchNarrowerzero-age-horizontal-branch-starsextreme-horizontal-branch-starshorizontal-coordinate-system (Preliminary)Horizontal coordinate systemThe coordinate system based on the position of the observer.

Hubble: ellipticals (E), spirals (S), barred spirals (SB), and irregulars (Ir). Later on a separate class of lenticulars (S0) was appended as an intermediate type between ellipticals and spirals. The sequence starts with round elliptical galaxies (E0). Flatter galaxies are arranged following a number which is calculated from the ratio (a - b)/a, where a and b are the major and minor axes as measured on the sky. Ellipticals are divided into eight categories (E0, E1, ..., E7). Beyond E7 a clear disk is apparent in the lenticular (S0) galaxies. The sequence then splits into two parallel branches of disk galaxies showing spiral structure: ordinary spirals, S, and barred spirals, SB. The spiral and barred types are subdivided into Sa, Sb, Sc, and SBa, SBb, SBc, respectively. Along the sequence from Sa to Sc, the central bulge becomes smaller, while the spiral arms become more and more paramount. The original, erroneous idea that such arrangement of the galaxies might represent an evolutionary sequence led to the ellipticals being referred to as early-type galaxies, and the spirals and Irr I irregulars as late-type galaxies.galaxy-classification-systemsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/757Related#spiral-galaxies#elliptical-galaxies#irregular-galaxies#lenticular-galaxieshubble-constant (Preliminary)Hubble constantThe Hubble parameter for the present epoch. It is the constant of proportionality between the recession velocities of galaxies and their distances from each other. The latest determinations using the Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheids give H_0 = 72 ± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, the WMAP observations yield 70.4 ± 1.3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and the Planck Satellite observations give 67.3 ± 1.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. More recently, the Hubble constant was derived by a team of astronomers, using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, with a 2.4% accuracy. The new value, 73.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, suggests that the Universe is expanding between five and nine percent faster than previously calculated. The Hubble law is only applicable for large distances (> 20 Mpc), when the proper motions of galaxies in groups and clusters cannot confuse the recession due to expansion.cosmological-parameters, observational-cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/758hubble-diagram (Preliminary)Hubble diagramA plot of the redshift of galaxies against their distance or against their apparent magnitude.hubble-s-lawSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/759hubble-radius (Preliminary)Hubble radiusThe size of the observable Universe as derived from the ratio c/H_0, where H_0 is the Hubble-Lemaitre constant and c the speed of light.galaxy-distancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/760hubble-s-law (Preliminary)Hubble-Lemaitre lawThe speed with which a galaxy cluster recedes from us is directly proportional to its distance.

The temperature is plotted in the inverse direction, with high temperatures on the left and low temperatures on the right. On the diagram the majority of stars are concentrated in a diagonal strip running from upper left to lower right, i.e. from high temperature-high luminosity massive stars to low temperature-low luminosity low-mass stars. This feature is known as the main sequence. This is the locus of stars burning hydrogen in their cores (proton-proton chain). The lower edge of this strip, known as the zero age main sequence (ZAMS), designates the positions where stars of different mass first begin to burn hydrogen in their cores. Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that, despite being very hot, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core. They are no longer generating energy but are merely emitting light as they cool (white dwarf cooling track). Stars with high luminosities but relatively low temperatures occupy a wide region above the main sequence. The majority of them have used up all the hydrogen in their cores and have expanded and cooled as a result of internal readjustment. Called red giants, they are still burning helium in their cores (helium burning, carbon burning). There are also stars with very high luminosities, resulting from their enormous outputs of energy, because they are burning their fuel at a prodigious rate. These are the supergiants. They can be hot or cool, hence blue or red in color.stellar-evolutionary-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/725Related#zero-age-horizontal-branch-stars#zero-age-main-sequence-stars#hayashi-track#henyey-track#evolved-stars#stellar-evolutionary-types#stellar-physicsNarrowerpre-main-sequenceasymptotic-giant-branchturnoff-pointinstability-strippost-asymptotic-giant-branchblue-loopgiant-branchmain-sequencehertzsprung-gaphorizontal-branchheterodyne-interferometry (Preliminary)Heterodyne interferometryinterferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/726heterodyne-receivers (Preliminary)Heterodyne receiversradio-telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/727hi-shells (Preliminary)HI shellsh-i-regionsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/728hickson-compact-group (Preliminary)Hickson compact groupgalaxy-groupsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/729hierarchical-cosmology (Preliminary)Hierarchical cosmologyA cosmology characterized by clustering of galaxy clusters in increasingly larger systems.cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/730hierarchical-models (Preliminary)Hierarchical modelsbayesian-statisticsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1925high-altitude-balloons (Preliminary)High altitude balloonsastronomical-instrumentationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/738high-angular-resolution (Preliminary)High angular resolutionastronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2167high-energy-astrophysics (Preliminary)High energy astrophysicsA branch of astrophysics that deals with objects emitting highly energetic radiation, such as X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, and extreme ultraviolet astronomy, as well as neutrinos and cosmic rays.Same Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/739Narroweractive-galactic-nucleiblack-holeswarm-hot-intergalactic-mediumblack-hole-physicsdark-mattertransient-sourcesjetsplasma-astrophysicsseyfert-galaxiesparticle-astrophysicsburst-astrophysicsintracluster-mediumneutrino-astronomyrelativistic-binary-starshigh-energy-cosmic-radiation (Preliminary)High-energy cosmic radiationcosmic-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/731high-latitude-field (Preliminary)High latitude fieldfield-of-viewSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/737high-luminosity-active-galactic-nuclei (Preliminary)High-luminosity active galactic nucleiactive-galactic-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2034high-mass-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)High mass x-ray binary starsA member of one of the two main classes of X-ray binary systems where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole and the other one a massive star.

It displays a stage of stellar evolution which immediately follows the red giant branch (RGB) in stars with an initial mass < 1.2 M_sun. When the star's ascent of the RGB is terminated by the helium flash, it moves down to the Horizontal Branch (HB). The star's effective temperature on the HB is higher than it was on the RGB, but the luminosity is considerably less than at the helium flash. Usually HB stars have two energy sources: in addition to the helium burning in their cores, they experience hydrogen fusion in a surrounding shell. The thickness of the shell determines the color of the HB stars. A thin shell, involving low opacity, makes the star look blue. The HB domain encompasses a very large effective temperature range with several members: extreme HB, blue HB, RR Lyrae, red HB, and red clump stars. The locations depend on many parameters, including stellar mass, metallicity, age, helium abundance, and rotation.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2048Related#zero-age-horizontal-branch-stars#horizontal-branch-stars#extreme-horizontal-branch-starshorizontal-branch-stars (Preliminary)Horizontal branch starsA star lying on the horizontal branch.stellar-evolutionary-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/746Related#horizontal-branchNarrowerzero-age-horizontal-branch-starsextreme-horizontal-branch-starshorizontal-coordinate-system (Preliminary)Horizontal coordinate systemThe coordinate system based on the position of the observer.

Hubble: ellipticals (E), spirals (S), barred spirals (SB), and irregulars (Ir). Later on a separate class of lenticulars (S0) was appended as an intermediate type between ellipticals and spirals. The sequence starts with round elliptical galaxies (E0). Flatter galaxies are arranged following a number which is calculated from the ratio (a - b)/a, where a and b are the major and minor axes as measured on the sky. Ellipticals are divided into eight categories (E0, E1, ..., E7). Beyond E7 a clear disk is apparent in the lenticular (S0) galaxies. The sequence then splits into two parallel branches of disk galaxies showing spiral structure: ordinary spirals, S, and barred spirals, SB. The spiral and barred types are subdivided into Sa, Sb, Sc, and SBa, SBb, SBc, respectively. Along the sequence from Sa to Sc, the central bulge becomes smaller, while the spiral arms become more and more paramount. The original, erroneous idea that such arrangement of the galaxies might represent an evolutionary sequence led to the ellipticals being referred to as early-type galaxies, and the spirals and Irr I irregulars as late-type galaxies.galaxy-classification-systemsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/757Related#spiral-galaxies#elliptical-galaxies#irregular-galaxies#lenticular-galaxieshubble-constant (Preliminary)Hubble constantThe Hubble parameter for the present epoch. It is the constant of proportionality between the recession velocities of galaxies and their distances from each other. The latest determinations using the Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheids give H_0 = 72 ± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, the WMAP observations yield 70.4 ± 1.3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and the Planck Satellite observations give 67.3 ± 1.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. More recently, the Hubble constant was derived by a team of astronomers, using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, with a 2.4% accuracy. The new value, 73.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, suggests that the Universe is expanding between five and nine percent faster than previously calculated. The Hubble law is only applicable for large distances (> 20 Mpc), when the proper motions of galaxies in groups and clusters cannot confuse the recession due to expansion.cosmological-parameters, observational-cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/758hubble-diagram (Preliminary)Hubble diagramA plot of the redshift of galaxies against their distance or against their apparent magnitude.hubble-s-lawSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/759hubble-radius (Preliminary)Hubble radiusThe size of the observable Universe as derived from the ratio c/H_0, where H_0 is the Hubble-Lemaitre constant and c the speed of light.galaxy-distancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/760hubble-s-law (Preliminary)Hubble-Lemaitre lawThe speed with which a galaxy cluster recedes from us is directly proportional to its distance.

HB,Horizontal Branch,"The surface of the Sun vibrates much like a bell. A piano has 88 keys or musical tones, whereas the Sun has millions of notes. These vibrations are the result of internal pressure waves that reflect off the photosphere and repeatedly cross the solar interior. They are detected through the Doppler shift of absorption lines formed in the photosphere. Because these vibrations make the solar surface move up and down, analysis of the surface patterns is used to study conditions far below the Sun's surface. The mean period of the vibrations is about five minutes, which corresponds to a frequency of about 3 mHz.solar-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/709Related#solar-interior#asteroseismologyNarrowersolar-magnetic-fieldssolar-cyclehelioseismic-pulsationsheliosheath (Preliminary)HeliosheathThe region located between the termination shock and the heliopause where the turbulent and hot solar wind is compressed as it passes outward against the interstellar wind.heliosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/710heliosphere (Preliminary)HeliosphereThe vast, three-dimensional region of space around the Sun filled with the solar wind and the remnant of the solar magnetic field carried in it.

These vibrations are the result of internal pressure waves that reflect off the photosphere and repeatedly cross the solar interior. They are detected through the Doppler shift of absorption lines formed in the photosphere. Because these vibrations make the solar surface move up and down, analysis of the surface patterns is used to study conditions far below the Sun's surface. The mean period of the vibrations is about five minutes, which corresponds to a frequency of about 3 mHz.solar-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/709Related#solar-interior#asteroseismologyNarrowersolar-magnetic-fieldssolar-cyclehelioseismic-pulsationsheliosheath (Preliminary)HeliosheathThe region located between the termination shock and the heliopause where the turbulent and hot solar wind is compressed as it passes outward against the interstellar wind.heliosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/710heliosphere (Preliminary)HeliosphereThe vast, three-dimensional region of space around the Sun filled with the solar wind and the remnant of the solar magnetic field carried in it.

The temperature is plotted in the inverse direction, with high temperatures on the left and low temperatures on the right. On the diagram the majority of stars are concentrated in a diagonal strip running from upper left to lower right, i.e. from high temperature-high luminosity massive stars to low temperature-low luminosity low-mass stars. This feature is known as the main sequence. This is the locus of stars burning hydrogen in their cores (proton-proton chain). The lower edge of this strip, known as the zero age main sequence (ZAMS), designates the positions where stars of different mass first begin to burn hydrogen in their cores. Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that, despite being very hot, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core. They are no longer generating energy but are merely emitting light as they cool (white dwarf cooling track). Stars with high luminosities but relatively low temperatures occupy a wide region above the main sequence. The majority of them have used up all the hydrogen in their cores and have expanded and cooled as a result of internal readjustment. Called red giants, they are still burning helium in their cores (helium burning, carbon burning). There are also stars with very high luminosities, resulting from their enormous outputs of energy, because they are burning their fuel at a prodigious rate. These are the supergiants. They can be hot or cool, hence blue or red in color.stellar-evolutionary-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/725Related#zero-age-horizontal-branch-stars#zero-age-main-sequence-stars#hayashi-track#henyey-track#evolved-stars#stellar-evolutionary-types#stellar-physicsNarrowerpre-main-sequenceasymptotic-giant-branchturnoff-pointinstability-strippost-asymptotic-giant-branchblue-loopgiant-branchmain-sequencehertzsprung-gaphorizontal-branchheterodyne-interferometry (Preliminary)Heterodyne interferometryinterferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/726heterodyne-receivers (Preliminary)Heterodyne receiversradio-telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/727hi-shells (Preliminary)HI shellsh-i-regionsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/728hickson-compact-group (Preliminary)Hickson compact groupgalaxy-groupsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/729hierarchical-cosmology (Preliminary)Hierarchical cosmologyA cosmology characterized by clustering of galaxy clusters in increasingly larger systems.cosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/730hierarchical-models (Preliminary)Hierarchical modelsbayesian-statisticsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1925high-altitude-balloons (Preliminary)High altitude balloonsastronomical-instrumentationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/738high-angular-resolution (Preliminary)High angular resolutionastronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2167high-energy-astrophysics (Preliminary)High energy astrophysicsA branch of astrophysics that deals with objects emitting highly energetic radiation, such as X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, and extreme ultraviolet astronomy, as well as neutrinos and cosmic rays.Same Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/739Narroweractive-galactic-nucleiblack-holeswarm-hot-intergalactic-mediumblack-hole-physicsdark-mattertransient-sourcesjetsplasma-astrophysicsseyfert-galaxiesparticle-astrophysicsburst-astrophysicsintracluster-mediumneutrino-astronomyrelativistic-binary-starshigh-energy-cosmic-radiation (Preliminary)High-energy cosmic radiationcosmic-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/731high-latitude-field (Preliminary)High latitude fieldfield-of-viewSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/737high-luminosity-active-galactic-nuclei (Preliminary)High-luminosity active galactic nucleiactive-galactic-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2034high-mass-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)High mass x-ray binary starsA member of one of the two main classes of X-ray binary systems where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole and the other one a massive star.

It displays a stage of stellar evolution which immediately follows the red giant branch (RGB) in stars with an initial mass < 1.2 M_sun. When the star's ascent of the RGB is terminated by the helium flash, it moves down to the Horizontal Branch (HB). The star's effective temperature on the HB is higher than it was on the RGB, but the luminosity is considerably less than at the helium flash. Usually HB stars have two energy sources: in addition to the helium burning in their cores, they experience hydrogen fusion in a surrounding shell. The thickness of the shell determines the color of the HB stars. A thin shell, involving low opacity, makes the star look blue. The HB domain encompasses a very large effective temperature range with several members: extreme HB, blue HB, RR Lyrae, red HB, and red clump stars.

Depending on the location and direction of motion, this criterion typically corresponds to a stellar velocity in the Galactic rest frame larger than 400 km s^-1, and up to about 1200 km s^-1. The nature of the hypervelocity stars (HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K.

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

SMBH,from the Galactic supermassive black hole,"The deuterium nucleus then rapidly captures another proton to form a Helium-3 nucleus, while emitting a gamma ray. There are three alternatives for the next step. In the proton-proton chain, occurring in 86% of the cases, two Helium-3 nuclei fuse to a final Helium-4 nucleus while two protons are released. The mass of the resulting Helium-4 nucleus is less than the total mass of the four original protons. The difference, ~ 0.7% of the total mass of the protons, is converted into energy and radiated by the Sun.

Depending on the location and direction of motion, this criterion typically corresponds to a stellar velocity in the Galactic rest frame larger than 400 km s^-1, and up to about 1200 km s^-1. The nature of the hypervelocity stars (HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K.

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

ICM,The Intracluster medium,"The deuterium nucleus then rapidly captures another proton to form a Helium-3 nucleus, while emitting a gamma ray. There are three alternatives for the next step. In the proton-proton chain, occurring in 86% of the cases, two Helium-3 nuclei fuse to a final Helium-4 nucleus while two protons are released. The mass of the resulting Helium-4 nucleus is less than the total mass of the four original protons. The difference, ~ 0.7% of the total mass of the protons, is converted into energy and radiated by the Sun.

Depending on the location and direction of motion, this criterion typically corresponds to a stellar velocity in the Galactic rest frame larger than 400 km s^-1, and up to about 1200 km s^-1. The nature of the hypervelocity stars (HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K.

As a result, the light is 'reddened' as it travels through space. Robert J.

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3630 km, Io is slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It revolves at a mean distance of 422,000 km from Jupiter. Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out. Some of Io's volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark.galilean-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2190ionization (Preliminary)IonizationThe process by which ions are produced, typically occurring by interaction with electromagnetic radiation ('photoionization'), or by collisions with atoms or electrons ('collisional ionization').atomic-physics, molecular-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2068Narrowerphotoionizationcharge-exchange-ionizationelectron-impact-ionizationionized-coma-gases (Preliminary)Ionized coma gasescomaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/277ionosphere (Preliminary)Earth ionosphereThe region of the Earth's upper atmosphere containing a small percentage of free electrons and ions produced by photoionization of the constituents of the atmosphere by solar ultraviolet radiation.earth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/860Related#ionospheric-scintillationNarrowerf-layerd-layere-layerionospheric-scintillation (Preliminary)Ionospheric scintillationatmospheric-scintillationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/861Related#ionosphereiron-meteorites (Preliminary)Iron meteoritesA meteorite which is composed mainly of iron mixed with smaller amounts of nickel.

CN,bands due to cyanogen,"(HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873Related#jovian-satellitesjupiter-trojans (Preliminary)Jupiter trojansThe family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter.

Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.luminosity-classificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882Related#variable-starskapteyn-selected-areas (Preliminary)Kapteyn Selected AreassurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/883keplerian-orbit (Preliminary)Keplerian orbitThe orbit of a spherical object of a finite mass around another spherical object, also of finite mass, governed by their mutual gravitational forces only.orbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/884kerr-black-holes (Preliminary)Kerr black holesA black hole that possesses only mass (not electric charge) and rotates about a central axis.

The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years.

It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.laser-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920likelihood-ratio-test (Preliminary)Likelihood ratio testmodel-selectionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1942limb-brightening (Preliminary)Limb brighteningAn observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921limb-darkening (Preliminary)Limb darkeningAn apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center. Limb darkening is readily apparent in photographs of the Sun. The reason is that when we look toward the disk's center we look into deeper and hence hotter layers along the line of sight. Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars. A similar phenomenon occurs in eclipsing binaries where the effect of limb darkening on one or both components manifests itself in the shape of the system's light curve.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/922limiting-magnitude (Preliminary)Limiting magnitudeThe faintest magnitude reachable by an instrument.apparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/923line-intensities (Preliminary)Line intensitiesmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2084line-of-sight (Preliminary)Line of sightThe imaginary straight line connecting the object and the objective lens of the viewing device.astronomical-locationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/924line-positions (Preliminary)Line positionsmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2085linear-regression (Preliminary)Linear regressionIn statistics, a regression method that establishes a linear relationship between two random variables.regressionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1945liner-galaxies (Preliminary)LINER galaxiesemission-line-galaxies, active-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/925lithium-stars (Preliminary)Lithium starschemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/927lithosphere (Preliminary)LithosphereThe solid portion of the Earth, as compared to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.

The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound. Another remarkable member of the Group is IC 10.galaxy-groupsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/929Narrowertriangulum-galaxymagellanic-cloudsmilky-way-galaxyandromeda-galaxylomb-scargle-periodogram (Preliminary)Lomb-Scargle periodogramAn algorithm for detecting and characterizing periodic signals in unevenly-sampled data.

The central regions of many of them resemble a dwarf galaxy, but most of the mass is contained in a large gaseous disk of low density that is observable only with long-exposure optical images or at radio wavelengths. Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars.

This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951Narrowersaros-cyclelunar-evolution (Preliminary)Lunar evolutionlunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/952lunar-features (Preliminary)Lunar featuresselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/953Narrowerlunar-rilleslunar-marialunar-domeslunar-mountainslunar-highlandslunar-transient-phenomenalunar-rayslunar-craterslunar-geochronology (Preliminary)Lunar geochronologylunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/954lunar-geodesy (Preliminary)Lunar geodesyselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/955lunar-gravitational-field (Preliminary)Lunar gravitational fieldselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/956lunar-highlands (Preliminary)Lunar highlandsA light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.lunar-featuresSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957lunar-impacts (Preliminary)Lunar impactslunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/958Related#impact-phenomenalunar-interior (Preliminary)Lunar interiorselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/959Narrowerlunar-seismologylunar-compositionlunar-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Lunar magnetic fieldsselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/960lunar-maria (Preliminary)Lunar mariaAreas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings.

There are two sub-classes of magnetars, anomalous X-Ray pulsar (AXP)s and soft gamma repeater (SGR)s, that were thought for many years to be separate and unrelated objects. In fact SGRs and AXPs are both neutron stars possessing magnetic fields of unprecedented strength of 10^14 - 10^16 G, and that show both steady X-ray pulsations as well as soft gamma-ray bursts. Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s. New high-energy components discovered in the spectra of a number of AXPs and SGRs require non-thermal particle acceleration and look very similar to high-energy spectral components of young rotation-powered pulsars.magnetic-stars, neutron-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/992Narrowersoft-gamma-ray-repeatersmagnetic-anomalies (Preliminary)Magnetic anomaliesmagnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/993magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Magnetic fieldsA field of force that is generated by electric currents, or, equivalently, a region in which magnetic forces can be observed.astrophysical-magnetismSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/994Narrowerprimordial-magnetic-fieldsgeomagnetic-fieldsmagnetic-anomaliesmagnetic-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic starsA star whose spectral lines show the Zeeman effect.chemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/995Narrowermagnetic-variable-starsam-starsbp-starsmagnetarsmercury-manganese-starsmagnetic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic variable starsintrinsic-variable-stars, magnetic-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/996Narroweram-starsrapidly-oscillating-ap-starsx-arietis-variable-starsmagnetohydrodynamical-simulations (Preliminary)Magnetohydrodynamical simulationsastronomical-simulationsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1966Related#magnetohydrodynamicsmagnetohydrodynamics (Preliminary)MagnetohydrodynamicsThe dynamics of an ionized plasma in the non-relativistic, collisional case.

The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732Narrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsmatter-density (Preliminary)Matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1014maunder-minimum (Preliminary)Maunder minimumA period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low.

The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024meridian (Preliminary)MeridianAn imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.horizontal-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026meridian-circles (Preliminary)Meridian circlesA telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.transit-instruments, telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027mesogranulation (Preliminary)Mesogranulationsolar-granulationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1028mesopause (Preliminary)Mesopauseearth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1029mesosphere (Preliminary)MesosphereThe layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height.

AU,or 30 astronomical units,"(HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798integrated-magnitude (Preliminary)Integrated magnitudeThe magnitude an extended object (nebula, galaxy, etc.) would have if all of its light were concentrated into a point source.magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/800interacting-binary-stars (Preliminary)Interacting binary starsclose-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/801Narrowerstellar-mergerscommon-envelope-binary-starscontact-binary-starscompact-binary-starssemi-detached-binary-starssymbiotic-binary-starsinteracting-galaxies (Preliminary)Interacting galaxiesGalaxies that are close enough for their mutual gravitational attraction to produce perturbed shapes or extruded filaments of stellar material, called tidal tails.

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873Related#jovian-satellitesjupiter-trojans (Preliminary)Jupiter trojansThe family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter.

Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats.

It is approximately on the border between the constellations Dorado and Mensa in a region of faint stars. The center of the LMC is approximately RA: 5h 23m 35s, dec: -69° 45' 22''. The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two ""embryonic"" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more. Based on 20 eclipsing binary systems, the distance to the LMC is measured to one percent precision to be 49.59±0.09 (statistical) ±0.54 (systematic) kpc.magellanic-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/903large-scale-structure-of-the-universe (Preliminary)Large-scale structure of the universecosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/902Narrowergreat-attractorvoidscosmic-webwarm-hot-intergalactic-mediumlow-density-fieldsmean-matter-densitydark-matter-distributionisothermal-sphere-profilelaser-guide-stars (Preliminary)Laser guide starsastronomical-opticsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/904laser-interferometry (Preliminary)Laser interferometryinterferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/905Narrowerligolate-stellar-evolution (Preliminary)Late stellar evolutionstellar-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/911Narrowerdredge-upstellar-accretion-diskslate-type-dwarf-stars (Preliminary)Late-type dwarf starslate-type-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/906Narrowerl-dwarfsk-dwarf-starst-dwarfsm-dwarf-starslate-type-galaxies (Preliminary)Late-type galaxiesIn the Hubble classification, a galaxy on the left part of the Hubble sequence.galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/907late-type-giant-stars (Preliminary)Late-type giant starslate-type-stars, giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/908Related#carbon-starsNarrowerirregular-variable-starsm-giant-starsmira-variable-starssemi-regular-variable-starsheavy-metal-starsk-giant-starslate-type-stars (Preliminary)Late-type starsA star of spectral type K, M, S, or C, with a surface temperature lower than that of the Sun.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/909Narrowerlate-type-supergiant-starslate-type-giant-starsm-starsr-starsk-starslate-type-dwarf-starsn-starss-starslate-type-supergiant-stars (Preliminary)Late-type supergiant starslate-type-stars, supergiant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/910Narrowerred-supergiant-starsm-supergiant-starsk-supergiant-starslb-variable-stars (Preliminary)Lb variable starsslow-irregular-variable-stars, giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/912lc-variable-stars (Preliminary)Lc variable starsirregular-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/913lemaitre-universe (Preliminary)Lemaitre universecosmological-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/914lens-orbital-motion (Preliminary)Lens orbital motiongravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2143lenticular-galaxies (Preliminary)Lenticular galaxiesdisk-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/915Related#hubble-classification-scheme#de-vaucouleurs-sandage-classificationleptogenesis (Preliminary)Leptogenesisearly-universeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/916libration (Preliminary)LibrationSmall oscillations of a celestial body about its mean position.

It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.laser-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920likelihood-ratio-test (Preliminary)Likelihood ratio testmodel-selectionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1942limb-brightening (Preliminary)Limb brighteningAn observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921limb-darkening (Preliminary)Limb darkeningAn apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center. Limb darkening is readily apparent in photographs of the Sun. The reason is that when we look toward the disk's center we look into deeper and hence hotter layers along the line of sight. Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars. A similar phenomenon occurs in eclipsing binaries where the effect of limb darkening on one or both components manifests itself in the shape of the system's light curve.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/922limiting-magnitude (Preliminary)Limiting magnitudeThe faintest magnitude reachable by an instrument.apparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/923line-intensities (Preliminary)Line intensitiesmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2084line-of-sight (Preliminary)Line of sightThe imaginary straight line connecting the object and the objective lens of the viewing device.astronomical-locationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/924line-positions (Preliminary)Line positionsmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2085linear-regression (Preliminary)Linear regressionIn statistics, a regression method that establishes a linear relationship between two random variables.regressionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1945liner-galaxies (Preliminary)LINER galaxiesemission-line-galaxies, active-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/925lithium-stars (Preliminary)Lithium starschemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/927lithosphere (Preliminary)LithosphereThe solid portion of the Earth, as compared to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.

The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound.

Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe.

There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951Narrowersaros-cyclelunar-evolution (Preliminary)Lunar evolutionlunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/952lunar-features (Preliminary)Lunar featuresselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/953Narrowerlunar-rilleslunar-marialunar-domeslunar-mountainslunar-highlandslunar-transient-phenomenalunar-rayslunar-craterslunar-geochronology (Preliminary)Lunar geochronologylunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/954lunar-geodesy (Preliminary)Lunar geodesyselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/955lunar-gravitational-field (Preliminary)Lunar gravitational fieldselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/956lunar-highlands (Preliminary)Lunar highlandsA light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.lunar-featuresSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957lunar-impacts (Preliminary)Lunar impactslunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/958Related#impact-phenomenalunar-interior (Preliminary)Lunar interiorselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/959Narrowerlunar-seismologylunar-compositionlunar-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Lunar magnetic fieldsselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/960lunar-maria (Preliminary)Lunar mariaAreas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings.

There are two sub-classes of magnetars, anomalous X-Ray pulsar (AXP)s and soft gamma repeater (SGR)s, that were thought for many years to be separate and unrelated objects. In fact SGRs and AXPs are both neutron stars possessing magnetic fields of unprecedented strength of 10^14 - 10^16 G, and that show both steady X-ray pulsations as well as soft gamma-ray bursts. Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s. New high-energy components discovered in the spectra of a number of AXPs and SGRs require non-thermal particle acceleration and look very similar to high-energy spectral components of young rotation-powered pulsars.magnetic-stars, neutron-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/992Narrowersoft-gamma-ray-repeatersmagnetic-anomalies (Preliminary)Magnetic anomaliesmagnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/993magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Magnetic fieldsA field of force that is generated by electric currents, or, equivalently, a region in which magnetic forces can be observed.astrophysical-magnetismSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/994Narrowerprimordial-magnetic-fieldsgeomagnetic-fieldsmagnetic-anomaliesmagnetic-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic starsA star whose spectral lines show the Zeeman effect.chemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/995Narrowermagnetic-variable-starsam-starsbp-starsmagnetarsmercury-manganese-starsmagnetic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic variable starsintrinsic-variable-stars, magnetic-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/996Narroweram-starsrapidly-oscillating-ap-starsx-arietis-variable-starsmagnetohydrodynamical-simulations (Preliminary)Magnetohydrodynamical simulationsastronomical-simulationsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1966Related#magnetohydrodynamicsmagnetohydrodynamics (Preliminary)MagnetohydrodynamicsThe dynamics of an ionized plasma in the non-relativistic, collisional case.

The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732Narrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsmatter-density (Preliminary)Matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1014maunder-minimum (Preliminary)Maunder minimumA period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low.

The reason is that the cosmic rays which produce carbon-14 reach the Earth in a greater number when there is weak solar activity. The Maunder minimum occurred during a period of cooling of the Earth, called the Little Ice Age.

The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024meridian (Preliminary)MeridianAn imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.horizontal-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026meridian-circles (Preliminary)Meridian circlesA telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.transit-instruments, telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027mesogranulation (Preliminary)Mesogranulationsolar-granulationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1028mesopause (Preliminary)Mesopauseearth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1029mesosphere (Preliminary)MesosphereThe layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height.

VO,(TiO) and vanadium oxide,"(HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798integrated-magnitude (Preliminary)Integrated magnitudeThe magnitude an extended object (nebula, galaxy, etc.) would have if all of its light were concentrated into a point source.magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/800interacting-binary-stars (Preliminary)Interacting binary starsclose-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/801Narrowerstellar-mergerscommon-envelope-binary-starscontact-binary-starscompact-binary-starssemi-detached-binary-starssymbiotic-binary-starsinteracting-galaxies (Preliminary)Interacting galaxiesGalaxies that are close enough for their mutual gravitational attraction to produce perturbed shapes or extruded filaments of stellar material, called tidal tails.

Since shorter wavelengths are particularly affected, the spectrum of the light is increasingly dominated by the long wavelength end of the spectrum. As a result, the light is 'reddened' as it travels through space. Robert J. Trumpler (1886-1956), a Swiss-American astronomer, was the first to produce a definite evidence of the existence of interstellar extinction and to estimate its magnitude (1930).interstellar-extinctionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/853interstellar-scattering (Preliminary)Interstellar scatteringinterstellar-mediumSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/854Narrowerinterstellar-dust-extinctioninterstellar-scintillation (Preliminary)Interstellar scintillationAn apparent twinkling of the signals from distant point-like radio sources (pulsars).

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873Related#jovian-satellitesjupiter-trojans (Preliminary)Jupiter trojansThe family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter.

Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.luminosity-classificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882Related#variable-starskapteyn-selected-areas (Preliminary)Kapteyn Selected AreassurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/883keplerian-orbit (Preliminary)Keplerian orbitThe orbit of a spherical object of a finite mass around another spherical object, also of finite mass, governed by their mutual gravitational forces only.orbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/884kerr-black-holes (Preliminary)Kerr black holesA black hole that possesses only mass (not electric charge) and rotates about a central axis.

The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years.

The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two ""embryonic"" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more.

It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.laser-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920likelihood-ratio-test (Preliminary)Likelihood ratio testmodel-selectionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1942limb-brightening (Preliminary)Limb brighteningAn observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921limb-darkening (Preliminary)Limb darkeningAn apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center.

Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars.

The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound. Another remarkable member of the Group is IC 10.galaxy-groupsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/929Narrowertriangulum-galaxymagellanic-cloudsmilky-way-galaxyandromeda-galaxylomb-scargle-periodogram (Preliminary)Lomb-Scargle periodogramAn algorithm for detecting and characterizing periodic signals in unevenly-sampled data.

The central regions of many of them resemble a dwarf galaxy, but most of the mass is contained in a large gaseous disk of low density that is observable only with long-exposure optical images or at radio wavelengths. Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars.

This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951Narrowersaros-cyclelunar-evolution (Preliminary)Lunar evolutionlunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/952lunar-features (Preliminary)Lunar featuresselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/953Narrowerlunar-rilleslunar-marialunar-domeslunar-mountainslunar-highlandslunar-transient-phenomenalunar-rayslunar-craterslunar-geochronology (Preliminary)Lunar geochronologylunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/954lunar-geodesy (Preliminary)Lunar geodesyselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/955lunar-gravitational-field (Preliminary)Lunar gravitational fieldselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/956lunar-highlands (Preliminary)Lunar highlandsA light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.lunar-featuresSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957lunar-impacts (Preliminary)Lunar impactslunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/958Related#impact-phenomenalunar-interior (Preliminary)Lunar interiorselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/959Narrowerlunar-seismologylunar-compositionlunar-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Lunar magnetic fieldsselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/960lunar-maria (Preliminary)Lunar mariaAreas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings.

Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s.

The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732Narrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsmatter-density (Preliminary)Matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1014maunder-minimum (Preliminary)Maunder minimumA period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low.

The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024meridian (Preliminary)MeridianAn imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.horizontal-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026meridian-circles (Preliminary)Meridian circlesA telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.transit-instruments, telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027mesogranulation (Preliminary)Mesogranulationsolar-granulationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1028mesopause (Preliminary)Mesopauseearth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1029mesosphere (Preliminary)MesosphereThe layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height.

NSF,National Science Foundation,"(HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798integrated-magnitude (Preliminary)Integrated magnitudeThe magnitude an extended object (nebula, galaxy, etc.) would have if all of its light were concentrated into a point source.magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/800interacting-binary-stars (Preliminary)Interacting binary starsclose-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/801Narrowerstellar-mergerscommon-envelope-binary-starscontact-binary-starscompact-binary-starssemi-detached-binary-starssymbiotic-binary-starsinteracting-galaxies (Preliminary)Interacting galaxiesGalaxies that are close enough for their mutual gravitational attraction to produce perturbed shapes or extruded filaments of stellar material, called tidal tails.

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873Related#jovian-satellitesjupiter-trojans (Preliminary)Jupiter trojansThe family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter.

Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.luminosity-classificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882Related#variable-starskapteyn-selected-areas (Preliminary)Kapteyn Selected AreassurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/883keplerian-orbit (Preliminary)Keplerian orbitThe orbit of a spherical object of a finite mass around another spherical object, also of finite mass, governed by their mutual gravitational forces only.orbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/884kerr-black-holes (Preliminary)Kerr black holesA black hole that possesses only mass (not electric charge) and rotates about a central axis.

It is approximately on the border between the constellations Dorado and Mensa in a region of faint stars. The center of the LMC is approximately RA: 5h 23m 35s, dec: -69° 45' 22''. The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two ""embryonic"" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more. Based on 20 eclipsing binary systems, the distance to the LMC is measured to one percent precision to be 49.59±0.09 (statistical) ±0.54 (systematic) kpc.magellanic-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/903large-scale-structure-of-the-universe (Preliminary)Large-scale structure of the universecosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/902Narrowergreat-attractorvoidscosmic-webwarm-hot-intergalactic-mediumlow-density-fieldsmean-matter-densitydark-matter-distributionisothermal-sphere-profilelaser-guide-stars (Preliminary)Laser guide starsastronomical-opticsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/904laser-interferometry (Preliminary)Laser interferometryinterferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/905Narrowerligolate-stellar-evolution (Preliminary)Late stellar evolutionstellar-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/911Narrowerdredge-upstellar-accretion-diskslate-type-dwarf-stars (Preliminary)Late-type dwarf starslate-type-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/906Narrowerl-dwarfsk-dwarf-starst-dwarfsm-dwarf-starslate-type-galaxies (Preliminary)Late-type galaxiesIn the Hubble classification, a galaxy on the left part of the Hubble sequence.galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/907late-type-giant-stars (Preliminary)Late-type giant starslate-type-stars, giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/908Related#carbon-starsNarrowerirregular-variable-starsm-giant-starsmira-variable-starssemi-regular-variable-starsheavy-metal-starsk-giant-starslate-type-stars (Preliminary)Late-type starsA star of spectral type K, M, S, or C, with a surface temperature lower than that of the Sun.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/909Narrowerlate-type-supergiant-starslate-type-giant-starsm-starsr-starsk-starslate-type-dwarf-starsn-starss-starslate-type-supergiant-stars (Preliminary)Late-type supergiant starslate-type-stars, supergiant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/910Narrowerred-supergiant-starsm-supergiant-starsk-supergiant-starslb-variable-stars (Preliminary)Lb variable starsslow-irregular-variable-stars, giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/912lc-variable-stars (Preliminary)Lc variable starsirregular-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/913lemaitre-universe (Preliminary)Lemaitre universecosmological-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/914lens-orbital-motion (Preliminary)Lens orbital motiongravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2143lenticular-galaxies (Preliminary)Lenticular galaxiesdisk-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/915Related#hubble-classification-scheme#de-vaucouleurs-sandage-classificationleptogenesis (Preliminary)Leptogenesisearly-universeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/916libration (Preliminary)LibrationSmall oscillations of a celestial body about its mean position.

It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.laser-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920likelihood-ratio-test (Preliminary)Likelihood ratio testmodel-selectionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1942limb-brightening (Preliminary)Limb brighteningAn observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921limb-darkening (Preliminary)Limb darkeningAn apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center. Limb darkening is readily apparent in photographs of the Sun. The reason is that when we look toward the disk's center we look into deeper and hence hotter layers along the line of sight. Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars. A similar phenomenon occurs in eclipsing binaries where the effect of limb darkening on one or both components manifests itself in the shape of the system's light curve.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/922limiting-magnitude (Preliminary)Limiting magnitudeThe faintest magnitude reachable by an instrument.apparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/923line-intensities (Preliminary)Line intensitiesmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2084line-of-sight (Preliminary)Line of sightThe imaginary straight line connecting the object and the objective lens of the viewing device.astronomical-locationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/924line-positions (Preliminary)Line positionsmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2085linear-regression (Preliminary)Linear regressionIn statistics, a regression method that establishes a linear relationship between two random variables.regressionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1945liner-galaxies (Preliminary)LINER galaxiesemission-line-galaxies, active-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/925lithium-stars (Preliminary)Lithium starschemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/927lithosphere (Preliminary)LithosphereThe solid portion of the Earth, as compared to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.

The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound.

Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars.

This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951Narrowersaros-cyclelunar-evolution (Preliminary)Lunar evolutionlunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/952lunar-features (Preliminary)Lunar featuresselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/953Narrowerlunar-rilleslunar-marialunar-domeslunar-mountainslunar-highlandslunar-transient-phenomenalunar-rayslunar-craterslunar-geochronology (Preliminary)Lunar geochronologylunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/954lunar-geodesy (Preliminary)Lunar geodesyselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/955lunar-gravitational-field (Preliminary)Lunar gravitational fieldselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/956lunar-highlands (Preliminary)Lunar highlandsA light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.lunar-featuresSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957lunar-impacts (Preliminary)Lunar impactslunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/958Related#impact-phenomenalunar-interior (Preliminary)Lunar interiorselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/959Narrowerlunar-seismologylunar-compositionlunar-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Lunar magnetic fieldsselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/960lunar-maria (Preliminary)Lunar mariaAreas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings.

There are two sub-classes of magnetars, anomalous X-Ray pulsar (AXP)s and soft gamma repeater (SGR)s, that were thought for many years to be separate and unrelated objects. In fact SGRs and AXPs are both neutron stars possessing magnetic fields of unprecedented strength of 10^14 - 10^16 G, and that show both steady X-ray pulsations as well as soft gamma-ray bursts. Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s. New high-energy components discovered in the spectra of a number of AXPs and SGRs require non-thermal particle acceleration and look very similar to high-energy spectral components of young rotation-powered pulsars.magnetic-stars, neutron-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/992Narrowersoft-gamma-ray-repeatersmagnetic-anomalies (Preliminary)Magnetic anomaliesmagnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/993magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Magnetic fieldsA field of force that is generated by electric currents, or, equivalently, a region in which magnetic forces can be observed.astrophysical-magnetismSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/994Narrowerprimordial-magnetic-fieldsgeomagnetic-fieldsmagnetic-anomaliesmagnetic-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic starsA star whose spectral lines show the Zeeman effect.chemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/995Narrowermagnetic-variable-starsam-starsbp-starsmagnetarsmercury-manganese-starsmagnetic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic variable starsintrinsic-variable-stars, magnetic-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/996Narroweram-starsrapidly-oscillating-ap-starsx-arietis-variable-starsmagnetohydrodynamical-simulations (Preliminary)Magnetohydrodynamical simulationsastronomical-simulationsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1966Related#magnetohydrodynamicsmagnetohydrodynamics (Preliminary)MagnetohydrodynamicsThe dynamics of an ionized plasma in the non-relativistic, collisional case.

The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732Narrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsmatter-density (Preliminary)Matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1014maunder-minimum (Preliminary)Maunder minimumA period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low.

The reason is that the cosmic rays which produce carbon-14 reach the Earth in a greater number when there is weak solar activity. The Maunder minimum occurred during a period of cooling of the Earth, called the Little Ice Age.

The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024meridian (Preliminary)MeridianAn imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.horizontal-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026meridian-circles (Preliminary)Meridian circlesA telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.transit-instruments, telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027mesogranulation (Preliminary)Mesogranulationsolar-granulationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1028mesopause (Preliminary)Mesopauseearth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1029mesosphere (Preliminary)MesosphereThe layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height.

VO,(TiO) and vanadium oxide,"(HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798integrated-magnitude (Preliminary)Integrated magnitudeThe magnitude an extended object (nebula, galaxy, etc.) would have if all of its light were concentrated into a point source.magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/800interacting-binary-stars (Preliminary)Interacting binary starsclose-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/801Narrowerstellar-mergerscommon-envelope-binary-starscontact-binary-starscompact-binary-starssemi-detached-binary-starssymbiotic-binary-starsinteracting-galaxies (Preliminary)Interacting galaxiesGalaxies that are close enough for their mutual gravitational attraction to produce perturbed shapes or extruded filaments of stellar material, called tidal tails.

Since shorter wavelengths are particularly affected, the spectrum of the light is increasingly dominated by the long wavelength end of the spectrum. As a result, the light is 'reddened' as it travels through space. Robert J. Trumpler (1886-1956), a Swiss-American astronomer, was the first to produce a definite evidence of the existence of interstellar extinction and to estimate its magnitude (1930).interstellar-extinctionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/853interstellar-scattering (Preliminary)Interstellar scatteringinterstellar-mediumSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/854Narrowerinterstellar-dust-extinctioninterstellar-scintillation (Preliminary)Interstellar scintillationAn apparent twinkling of the signals from distant point-like radio sources (pulsars).

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873Related#jovian-satellitesjupiter-trojans (Preliminary)Jupiter trojansThe family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter.

Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.luminosity-classificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882Related#variable-starskapteyn-selected-areas (Preliminary)Kapteyn Selected AreassurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/883keplerian-orbit (Preliminary)Keplerian orbitThe orbit of a spherical object of a finite mass around another spherical object, also of finite mass, governed by their mutual gravitational forces only.orbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/884kerr-black-holes (Preliminary)Kerr black holesA black hole that possesses only mass (not electric charge) and rotates about a central axis.

The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two ""embryonic"" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more.

It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.laser-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920likelihood-ratio-test (Preliminary)Likelihood ratio testmodel-selectionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1942limb-brightening (Preliminary)Limb brighteningAn observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921limb-darkening (Preliminary)Limb darkeningAn apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center.

Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars.

The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound.

LMXBs mainly emit soft X-rays. The ratio of their optical to X-ray luminosities is less than 0.1. They belong to old stellar populations with ages 5-15 x 10^9 years and are found in globular clusters and in the bulge of our Milky Way galaxy; some are also found in the disk.

The central regions of many of them resemble a dwarf galaxy, but most of the mass is contained in a large gaseous disk of low density that is observable only with long-exposure optical images or at radio wavelengths. Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars.

This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951Narrowersaros-cyclelunar-evolution (Preliminary)Lunar evolutionlunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/952lunar-features (Preliminary)Lunar featuresselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/953Narrowerlunar-rilleslunar-marialunar-domeslunar-mountainslunar-highlandslunar-transient-phenomenalunar-rayslunar-craterslunar-geochronology (Preliminary)Lunar geochronologylunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/954lunar-geodesy (Preliminary)Lunar geodesyselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/955lunar-gravitational-field (Preliminary)Lunar gravitational fieldselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/956lunar-highlands (Preliminary)Lunar highlandsA light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.lunar-featuresSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957lunar-impacts (Preliminary)Lunar impactslunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/958Related#impact-phenomenalunar-interior (Preliminary)Lunar interiorselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/959Narrowerlunar-seismologylunar-compositionlunar-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Lunar magnetic fieldsselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/960lunar-maria (Preliminary)Lunar mariaAreas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings.

Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s.

The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732Narrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsmatter-density (Preliminary)Matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1014maunder-minimum (Preliminary)Maunder minimumA period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low.

The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024meridian (Preliminary)MeridianAn imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.horizontal-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026meridian-circles (Preliminary)Meridian circlesA telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.transit-instruments, telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027mesogranulation (Preliminary)Mesogranulationsolar-granulationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1028mesopause (Preliminary)Mesopauseearth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1029mesosphere (Preliminary)MesosphereThe layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height.

AXP,X Ray pulsar,"(HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798integrated-magnitude (Preliminary)Integrated magnitudeThe magnitude an extended object (nebula, galaxy, etc.) would have if all of its light were concentrated into a point source.magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/800interacting-binary-stars (Preliminary)Interacting binary starsclose-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/801Narrowerstellar-mergerscommon-envelope-binary-starscontact-binary-starscompact-binary-starssemi-detached-binary-starssymbiotic-binary-starsinteracting-galaxies (Preliminary)Interacting galaxiesGalaxies that are close enough for their mutual gravitational attraction to produce perturbed shapes or extruded filaments of stellar material, called tidal tails.

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873Related#jovian-satellitesjupiter-trojans (Preliminary)Jupiter trojansThe family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter.

Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.luminosity-classificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882Related#variable-starskapteyn-selected-areas (Preliminary)Kapteyn Selected AreassurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/883keplerian-orbit (Preliminary)Keplerian orbitThe orbit of a spherical object of a finite mass around another spherical object, also of finite mass, governed by their mutual gravitational forces only.orbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/884kerr-black-holes (Preliminary)Kerr black holesA black hole that possesses only mass (not electric charge) and rotates about a central axis.

It is approximately on the border between the constellations Dorado and Mensa in a region of faint stars. The center of the LMC is approximately RA: 5h 23m 35s, dec: -69° 45' 22''. The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two ""embryonic"" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more. Based on 20 eclipsing binary systems, the distance to the LMC is measured to one percent precision to be 49.59±0.09 (statistical) ±0.54 (systematic) kpc.magellanic-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/903large-scale-structure-of-the-universe (Preliminary)Large-scale structure of the universecosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/902Narrowergreat-attractorvoidscosmic-webwarm-hot-intergalactic-mediumlow-density-fieldsmean-matter-densitydark-matter-distributionisothermal-sphere-profilelaser-guide-stars (Preliminary)Laser guide starsastronomical-opticsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/904laser-interferometry (Preliminary)Laser interferometryinterferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/905Narrowerligolate-stellar-evolution (Preliminary)Late stellar evolutionstellar-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/911Narrowerdredge-upstellar-accretion-diskslate-type-dwarf-stars (Preliminary)Late-type dwarf starslate-type-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/906Narrowerl-dwarfsk-dwarf-starst-dwarfsm-dwarf-starslate-type-galaxies (Preliminary)Late-type galaxiesIn the Hubble classification, a galaxy on the left part of the Hubble sequence.galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/907late-type-giant-stars (Preliminary)Late-type giant starslate-type-stars, giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/908Related#carbon-starsNarrowerirregular-variable-starsm-giant-starsmira-variable-starssemi-regular-variable-starsheavy-metal-starsk-giant-starslate-type-stars (Preliminary)Late-type starsA star of spectral type K, M, S, or C, with a surface temperature lower than that of the Sun.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/909Narrowerlate-type-supergiant-starslate-type-giant-starsm-starsr-starsk-starslate-type-dwarf-starsn-starss-starslate-type-supergiant-stars (Preliminary)Late-type supergiant starslate-type-stars, supergiant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/910Narrowerred-supergiant-starsm-supergiant-starsk-supergiant-starslb-variable-stars (Preliminary)Lb variable starsslow-irregular-variable-stars, giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/912lc-variable-stars (Preliminary)Lc variable starsirregular-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/913lemaitre-universe (Preliminary)Lemaitre universecosmological-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/914lens-orbital-motion (Preliminary)Lens orbital motiongravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2143lenticular-galaxies (Preliminary)Lenticular galaxiesdisk-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/915Related#hubble-classification-scheme#de-vaucouleurs-sandage-classificationleptogenesis (Preliminary)Leptogenesisearly-universeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/916libration (Preliminary)LibrationSmall oscillations of a celestial body about its mean position.

It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.laser-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920likelihood-ratio-test (Preliminary)Likelihood ratio testmodel-selectionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1942limb-brightening (Preliminary)Limb brighteningAn observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921limb-darkening (Preliminary)Limb darkeningAn apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center. Limb darkening is readily apparent in photographs of the Sun. The reason is that when we look toward the disk's center we look into deeper and hence hotter layers along the line of sight. Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars. A similar phenomenon occurs in eclipsing binaries where the effect of limb darkening on one or both components manifests itself in the shape of the system's light curve.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/922limiting-magnitude (Preliminary)Limiting magnitudeThe faintest magnitude reachable by an instrument.apparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/923line-intensities (Preliminary)Line intensitiesmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2084line-of-sight (Preliminary)Line of sightThe imaginary straight line connecting the object and the objective lens of the viewing device.astronomical-locationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/924line-positions (Preliminary)Line positionsmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2085linear-regression (Preliminary)Linear regressionIn statistics, a regression method that establishes a linear relationship between two random variables.regressionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1945liner-galaxies (Preliminary)LINER galaxiesemission-line-galaxies, active-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/925lithium-stars (Preliminary)Lithium starschemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/927lithosphere (Preliminary)LithosphereThe solid portion of the Earth, as compared to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.

The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound.

Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars.

This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951Narrowersaros-cyclelunar-evolution (Preliminary)Lunar evolutionlunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/952lunar-features (Preliminary)Lunar featuresselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/953Narrowerlunar-rilleslunar-marialunar-domeslunar-mountainslunar-highlandslunar-transient-phenomenalunar-rayslunar-craterslunar-geochronology (Preliminary)Lunar geochronologylunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/954lunar-geodesy (Preliminary)Lunar geodesyselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/955lunar-gravitational-field (Preliminary)Lunar gravitational fieldselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/956lunar-highlands (Preliminary)Lunar highlandsA light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.lunar-featuresSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957lunar-impacts (Preliminary)Lunar impactslunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/958Related#impact-phenomenalunar-interior (Preliminary)Lunar interiorselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/959Narrowerlunar-seismologylunar-compositionlunar-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Lunar magnetic fieldsselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/960lunar-maria (Preliminary)Lunar mariaAreas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings.

There are two sub-classes of magnetars, anomalous X-Ray pulsar (AXP)s and soft gamma repeater (SGR)s, that were thought for many years to be separate and unrelated objects. In fact SGRs and AXPs are both neutron stars possessing magnetic fields of unprecedented strength of 10^14 - 10^16 G, and that show both steady X-ray pulsations as well as soft gamma-ray bursts. Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s. New high-energy components discovered in the spectra of a number of AXPs and SGRs require non-thermal particle acceleration and look very similar to high-energy spectral components of young rotation-powered pulsars.magnetic-stars, neutron-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/992Narrowersoft-gamma-ray-repeatersmagnetic-anomalies (Preliminary)Magnetic anomaliesmagnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/993magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Magnetic fieldsA field of force that is generated by electric currents, or, equivalently, a region in which magnetic forces can be observed.astrophysical-magnetismSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/994Narrowerprimordial-magnetic-fieldsgeomagnetic-fieldsmagnetic-anomaliesmagnetic-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic starsA star whose spectral lines show the Zeeman effect.chemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/995Narrowermagnetic-variable-starsam-starsbp-starsmagnetarsmercury-manganese-starsmagnetic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic variable starsintrinsic-variable-stars, magnetic-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/996Narroweram-starsrapidly-oscillating-ap-starsx-arietis-variable-starsmagnetohydrodynamical-simulations (Preliminary)Magnetohydrodynamical simulationsastronomical-simulationsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1966Related#magnetohydrodynamicsmagnetohydrodynamics (Preliminary)MagnetohydrodynamicsThe dynamics of an ionized plasma in the non-relativistic, collisional case.

The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732Narrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsmatter-density (Preliminary)Matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1014maunder-minimum (Preliminary)Maunder minimumA period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low.

The reason is that the cosmic rays which produce carbon-14 reach the Earth in a greater number when there is weak solar activity. The Maunder minimum occurred during a period of cooling of the Earth, called the Little Ice Age.

The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024meridian (Preliminary)MeridianAn imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.horizontal-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026meridian-circles (Preliminary)Meridian circlesA telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.transit-instruments, telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027mesogranulation (Preliminary)Mesogranulationsolar-granulationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1028mesopause (Preliminary)Mesopauseearth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1029mesosphere (Preliminary)MesosphereThe layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height.

SGR,(AXP)s and soft gamma repeater,"(HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798integrated-magnitude (Preliminary)Integrated magnitudeThe magnitude an extended object (nebula, galaxy, etc.) would have if all of its light were concentrated into a point source.magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/800interacting-binary-stars (Preliminary)Interacting binary starsclose-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/801Narrowerstellar-mergerscommon-envelope-binary-starscontact-binary-starscompact-binary-starssemi-detached-binary-starssymbiotic-binary-starsinteracting-galaxies (Preliminary)Interacting galaxiesGalaxies that are close enough for their mutual gravitational attraction to produce perturbed shapes or extruded filaments of stellar material, called tidal tails.

Since shorter wavelengths are particularly affected, the spectrum of the light is increasingly dominated by the long wavelength end of the spectrum. As a result, the light is 'reddened' as it travels through space. Robert J. Trumpler (1886-1956), a Swiss-American astronomer, was the first to produce a definite evidence of the existence of interstellar extinction and to estimate its magnitude (1930).interstellar-extinctionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/853interstellar-scattering (Preliminary)Interstellar scatteringinterstellar-mediumSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/854Narrowerinterstellar-dust-extinctioninterstellar-scintillation (Preliminary)Interstellar scintillationAn apparent twinkling of the signals from distant point-like radio sources (pulsars).

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873Related#jovian-satellitesjupiter-trojans (Preliminary)Jupiter trojansThe family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter.

Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.luminosity-classificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882Related#variable-starskapteyn-selected-areas (Preliminary)Kapteyn Selected AreassurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/883keplerian-orbit (Preliminary)Keplerian orbitThe orbit of a spherical object of a finite mass around another spherical object, also of finite mass, governed by their mutual gravitational forces only.orbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/884kerr-black-holes (Preliminary)Kerr black holesA black hole that possesses only mass (not electric charge) and rotates about a central axis.

The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two ""embryonic"" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more.

It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.laser-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920likelihood-ratio-test (Preliminary)Likelihood ratio testmodel-selectionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1942limb-brightening (Preliminary)Limb brighteningAn observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921limb-darkening (Preliminary)Limb darkeningAn apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center.

Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars.

The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound.

LMXBs mainly emit soft X-rays. The ratio of their optical to X-ray luminosities is less than 0.1. They belong to old stellar populations with ages 5-15 x 10^9 years and are found in globular clusters and in the bulge of our Milky Way galaxy; some are also found in the disk.

The central regions of many of them resemble a dwarf galaxy, but most of the mass is contained in a large gaseous disk of low density that is observable only with long-exposure optical images or at radio wavelengths. Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars.

This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951Narrowersaros-cyclelunar-evolution (Preliminary)Lunar evolutionlunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/952lunar-features (Preliminary)Lunar featuresselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/953Narrowerlunar-rilleslunar-marialunar-domeslunar-mountainslunar-highlandslunar-transient-phenomenalunar-rayslunar-craterslunar-geochronology (Preliminary)Lunar geochronologylunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/954lunar-geodesy (Preliminary)Lunar geodesyselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/955lunar-gravitational-field (Preliminary)Lunar gravitational fieldselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/956lunar-highlands (Preliminary)Lunar highlandsA light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.lunar-featuresSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957lunar-impacts (Preliminary)Lunar impactslunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/958Related#impact-phenomenalunar-interior (Preliminary)Lunar interiorselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/959Narrowerlunar-seismologylunar-compositionlunar-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Lunar magnetic fieldsselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/960lunar-maria (Preliminary)Lunar mariaAreas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings.

Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s.

The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732Narrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsmatter-density (Preliminary)Matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1014maunder-minimum (Preliminary)Maunder minimumA period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low.

The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024meridian (Preliminary)MeridianAn imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.horizontal-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026meridian-circles (Preliminary)Meridian circlesA telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.transit-instruments, telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027mesogranulation (Preliminary)Mesogranulationsolar-granulationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1028mesopause (Preliminary)Mesopauseearth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1029mesosphere (Preliminary)MesosphereThe layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height.

RPP,that powers rotation powered pulsar,"(HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.high-velocity-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776hz-herculis-x-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)Hz Herculis x-ray binary starslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/777ice-destruction (Preliminary)Ice destructionsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2091ice-formation (Preliminary)Ice formationsolid-matter-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2092impact-phenomena (Preliminary)Impact phenomenaplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/779Related#lunar-impacts#meteoritesimportance-sampling (Preliminary)Importance samplingmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1892inclination (Preliminary)InclinationAn orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.orbital-elementsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780indochinites (Preliminary)IndochinitestektitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/783inflationary-universe (Preliminary)Inflationary universeA class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories.

Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.hertzsprung-russell-diagramSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798integrated-magnitude (Preliminary)Integrated magnitudeThe magnitude an extended object (nebula, galaxy, etc.) would have if all of its light were concentrated into a point source.magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/800interacting-binary-stars (Preliminary)Interacting binary starsclose-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/801Narrowerstellar-mergerscommon-envelope-binary-starscontact-binary-starscompact-binary-starssemi-detached-binary-starssymbiotic-binary-starsinteracting-galaxies (Preliminary)Interacting galaxiesGalaxies that are close enough for their mutual gravitational attraction to produce perturbed shapes or extruded filaments of stellar material, called tidal tails.

The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.high-energy-astrophysics, galaxy-clustersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858Related#intergalactic-mediumNarrowercooling-flowsintrinsic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Intrinsic variable starsA variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859Narrowerherbig-haro-objectsmagnetic-variable-starscataclysmic-variable-starspulsating-variable-starseruptive-variable-starsio (Preliminary)IoThe fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest.

Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.

Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873Related#jovian-satellitesjupiter-trojans (Preliminary)Jupiter trojansThe family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter.

Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.luminosity-classificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882Related#variable-starskapteyn-selected-areas (Preliminary)Kapteyn Selected AreassurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/883keplerian-orbit (Preliminary)Keplerian orbitThe orbit of a spherical object of a finite mass around another spherical object, also of finite mass, governed by their mutual gravitational forces only.orbital-motionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/884kerr-black-holes (Preliminary)Kerr black holesA black hole that possesses only mass (not electric charge) and rotates about a central axis.

It is approximately on the border between the constellations Dorado and Mensa in a region of faint stars. The center of the LMC is approximately RA: 5h 23m 35s, dec: -69° 45' 22''. The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two ""embryonic"" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more. Based on 20 eclipsing binary systems, the distance to the LMC is measured to one percent precision to be 49.59±0.09 (statistical) ±0.54 (systematic) kpc.magellanic-cloudsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/903large-scale-structure-of-the-universe (Preliminary)Large-scale structure of the universecosmologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/902Narrowergreat-attractorvoidscosmic-webwarm-hot-intergalactic-mediumlow-density-fieldsmean-matter-densitydark-matter-distributionisothermal-sphere-profilelaser-guide-stars (Preliminary)Laser guide starsastronomical-opticsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/904laser-interferometry (Preliminary)Laser interferometryinterferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/905Narrowerligolate-stellar-evolution (Preliminary)Late stellar evolutionstellar-evolutionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/911Narrowerdredge-upstellar-accretion-diskslate-type-dwarf-stars (Preliminary)Late-type dwarf starslate-type-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/906Narrowerl-dwarfsk-dwarf-starst-dwarfsm-dwarf-starslate-type-galaxies (Preliminary)Late-type galaxiesIn the Hubble classification, a galaxy on the left part of the Hubble sequence.galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/907late-type-giant-stars (Preliminary)Late-type giant starslate-type-stars, giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/908Related#carbon-starsNarrowerirregular-variable-starsm-giant-starsmira-variable-starssemi-regular-variable-starsheavy-metal-starsk-giant-starslate-type-stars (Preliminary)Late-type starsA star of spectral type K, M, S, or C, with a surface temperature lower than that of the Sun.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/909Narrowerlate-type-supergiant-starslate-type-giant-starsm-starsr-starsk-starslate-type-dwarf-starsn-starss-starslate-type-supergiant-stars (Preliminary)Late-type supergiant starslate-type-stars, supergiant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/910Narrowerred-supergiant-starsm-supergiant-starsk-supergiant-starslb-variable-stars (Preliminary)Lb variable starsslow-irregular-variable-stars, giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/912lc-variable-stars (Preliminary)Lc variable starsirregular-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/913lemaitre-universe (Preliminary)Lemaitre universecosmological-modelsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/914lens-orbital-motion (Preliminary)Lens orbital motiongravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2143lenticular-galaxies (Preliminary)Lenticular galaxiesdisk-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/915Related#hubble-classification-scheme#de-vaucouleurs-sandage-classificationleptogenesis (Preliminary)Leptogenesisearly-universeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/916libration (Preliminary)LibrationSmall oscillations of a celestial body about its mean position.

It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.laser-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920likelihood-ratio-test (Preliminary)Likelihood ratio testmodel-selectionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1942limb-brightening (Preliminary)Limb brighteningAn observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921limb-darkening (Preliminary)Limb darkeningAn apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center. Limb darkening is readily apparent in photographs of the Sun. The reason is that when we look toward the disk's center we look into deeper and hence hotter layers along the line of sight. Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars. A similar phenomenon occurs in eclipsing binaries where the effect of limb darkening on one or both components manifests itself in the shape of the system's light curve.solar-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/922limiting-magnitude (Preliminary)Limiting magnitudeThe faintest magnitude reachable by an instrument.apparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/923line-intensities (Preliminary)Line intensitiesmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2084line-of-sight (Preliminary)Line of sightThe imaginary straight line connecting the object and the objective lens of the viewing device.astronomical-locationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/924line-positions (Preliminary)Line positionsmolecular-spectroscopy, atomic-spectroscopySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2085linear-regression (Preliminary)Linear regressionIn statistics, a regression method that establishes a linear relationship between two random variables.regressionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1945liner-galaxies (Preliminary)LINER galaxiesemission-line-galaxies, active-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/925lithium-stars (Preliminary)Lithium starschemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/927lithosphere (Preliminary)LithosphereThe solid portion of the Earth, as compared to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.

The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound.

Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars.

This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951Narrowersaros-cyclelunar-evolution (Preliminary)Lunar evolutionlunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/952lunar-features (Preliminary)Lunar featuresselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/953Narrowerlunar-rilleslunar-marialunar-domeslunar-mountainslunar-highlandslunar-transient-phenomenalunar-rayslunar-craterslunar-geochronology (Preliminary)Lunar geochronologylunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/954lunar-geodesy (Preliminary)Lunar geodesyselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/955lunar-gravitational-field (Preliminary)Lunar gravitational fieldselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/956lunar-highlands (Preliminary)Lunar highlandsA light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.lunar-featuresSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957lunar-impacts (Preliminary)Lunar impactslunar-surfaceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/958Related#impact-phenomenalunar-interior (Preliminary)Lunar interiorselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/959Narrowerlunar-seismologylunar-compositionlunar-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Lunar magnetic fieldsselenologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/960lunar-maria (Preliminary)Lunar mariaAreas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings.

There are two sub-classes of magnetars, anomalous X-Ray pulsar (AXP)s and soft gamma repeater (SGR)s, that were thought for many years to be separate and unrelated objects. In fact SGRs and AXPs are both neutron stars possessing magnetic fields of unprecedented strength of 10^14 - 10^16 G, and that show both steady X-ray pulsations as well as soft gamma-ray bursts. Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s. New high-energy components discovered in the spectra of a number of AXPs and SGRs require non-thermal particle acceleration and look very similar to high-energy spectral components of young rotation-powered pulsars.magnetic-stars, neutron-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/992Narrowersoft-gamma-ray-repeatersmagnetic-anomalies (Preliminary)Magnetic anomaliesmagnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/993magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Magnetic fieldsA field of force that is generated by electric currents, or, equivalently, a region in which magnetic forces can be observed.astrophysical-magnetismSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/994Narrowerprimordial-magnetic-fieldsgeomagnetic-fieldsmagnetic-anomaliesmagnetic-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic starsA star whose spectral lines show the Zeeman effect.chemically-peculiar-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/995Narrowermagnetic-variable-starsam-starsbp-starsmagnetarsmercury-manganese-starsmagnetic-variable-stars (Preliminary)Magnetic variable starsintrinsic-variable-stars, magnetic-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/996Narroweram-starsrapidly-oscillating-ap-starsx-arietis-variable-starsmagnetohydrodynamical-simulations (Preliminary)Magnetohydrodynamical simulationsastronomical-simulationsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1966Related#magnetohydrodynamicsmagnetohydrodynamics (Preliminary)MagnetohydrodynamicsThe dynamics of an ionized plasma in the non-relativistic, collisional case.

The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.stellar-typesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732Narrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsmatter-density (Preliminary)Matter densitydensity-parametersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1014maunder-minimum (Preliminary)Maunder minimumA period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low.

The reason is that the cosmic rays which produce carbon-14 reach the Earth in a greater number when there is weak solar activity. The Maunder minimum occurred during a period of cooling of the Earth, called the Little Ice Age.

The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.inner-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024meridian (Preliminary)MeridianAn imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.horizontal-coordinate-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026meridian-circles (Preliminary)Meridian circlesA telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.transit-instruments, telescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027mesogranulation (Preliminary)Mesogranulationsolar-granulationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1028mesopause (Preliminary)Mesopauseearth-atmosphereSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1029mesosphere (Preliminary)MesosphereThe layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height.

NO/NH,defined as the relative abundance of oxygen:,"In practice, the metallicity of stars is usually expressed by the number ratio of iron atoms to hydrogen atoms per unit volume, with respect to the solar values: [Fe/H] = log10(NFe/NH)star - log10(NFe/NH)Sun, where NFe and NH are the numbers of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume. In fact it is taken to be equal to the iron abundance with respect to the solar value. The solar logarithmic iron abundance is 7.50 ± 0.04, with respect to that of hydrogen which, by convention, is 12.00. Stellar metallicity is often expressed in mass fraction. Nebular metallicity is often defined as the relative abundance of oxygen: (NO/NH)neb/(NO/NH)Sun, where N_O and N_H represent the numbers of oxygen and hydrogen atoms per unit volume.chemical-abundancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1031meteor-radiants (Preliminary)Meteor radiantsmeteor-showersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1033meteor-showers (Preliminary)Meteor showersAn increased number of meteors all appearing to diverge from the direction of a single point, called radiant. Meteor showers occur annually on the same dates, when the Earth crosses through a meteoroid stream. Meteor showers are named after the constellation in which the radiant is located. For example, the Perseids's radiant lies near the top of the constellation Perseus. Most meteor showers are caused by comets. As a comet orbits the Sun it sheds an icy, dusty debris stream along its orbit. When the Earth's orbit intersects the dust trail, more meteors are seen as the cometary debris encounters our planet's atmosphere. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scattered by orbiting asteroids. Typical meteor showers show 15 to 100 meteors per hour at their peak. On very rare occasions, during a meteor storm, thousands of meteors fall per hour. Prominent meteor showers are: Quadrantids, Lyrids, Eta Aquariids, Delta Aquariids, Perseids, Orionids, Taurids, Leonids, Geminids, Ursids, Alpha Capricornids.meteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1034Narrowerzenith-hourly-ratemeteor-radiantsmeteor-streams (Preliminary)Meteor streamsThe meteoroids distributed all along an orbit and diffused somewhat around it.meteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1035meteor-trails (Preliminary)Meteor trailsmeteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1036meteorite-composition (Preliminary)Meteorite compositionmeteoritesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1037meteorites (Preliminary)MeteoritesAn object of extraterrestrial origin that survives entry through the atmosphere to reach the Earth's surface.

Meteors are also referred to as shooting stars. Very bright meteors are called fireball or bolide. Most of visible meteors arise from particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams. The brilliant flash of light from a meteor is mainly caused by the meteoroid's high level of kinetic energy as it collides with the atmosphere at high speeds (11-72 km/s). The increase in the number of meteors visible toward the end of the night results from the fact that the Earth rotates about its axis in the same direction as it orbits the Sun. This means that the leading edge (morning side) of the Earth encounters more meteoroids than the trailing edge (evening side). In general, 2 to 3 times as many meteors can be seen in the hour or so just before morning twilight, than can be seen in the early evening. Moreover, the numbers of random, or sporadic, meteors vary from season to season, due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis and other factors.meteoroidsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1041Related#meteoritesNarrowerfireballsmeteor-showersmeteor-trailsmeteor-streamsmethane (Preliminary)MethaneA colorless, odorless, inflammable gas of formula CH4; the simplest hydrocarbon.greenhouse-gasesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1042metropolis-hastings (Preliminary)Metropolis-Hastingsmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1893meyer-group (Preliminary)Meyer groupsunskirtersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2200michelson-interferometers (Preliminary)Michelson interferometersinterferometersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1044Related#michelson-interferometrymichelson-interferometry (Preliminary)Michelson interferometryoptical-phase-shifting-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1045Related#michelson-interferometersmicrogravity (Preliminary)MicrogravityThe state or condition where the force of gravity is very weak, e.g. the weightlessness experienced inside an orbiting spacecraft.space-researchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1046microlensing-event-rate (Preliminary)Microlensing event rategravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2146microlensing-optical-depth (Preliminary)Microlensing optical depthgravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2145microlensing-parallax (Preliminary)Microlensing parallaxgravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2144Related#parallaxNarrowerannual-microlensing-parallaxsatellite-microlensing-parallaxtopocentric-microlensing-parallaxmicrometeorites (Preliminary)MicrometeoritesA small grain sized meteorite which can only be positively identified under the microscope.meteoritesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1047micrometeoroids (Preliminary)MicrometeoroidsmeteoroidsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1048milky-way-dark-matter-halo (Preliminary)Milky Way dark matter halomilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1049Related#galaxy-dark-matter-halosmilky-way-disk (Preliminary)Milky Way diskmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1050Related#galaxy-disksmilky-way-dynamics (Preliminary)Milky Way dynamicsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1051Related#galaxy-dynamicsmilky-way-evolution (Preliminary)Milky Way evolutionmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1052Related#galaxy-evolutionmilky-way-formation (Preliminary)Milky Way formationmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1053Related#galaxy-formationmilky-way-galaxy (Preliminary)Milky Way GalaxyA spiral galaxy, of which the solar system is a small part. It is the second largest in our Local Group of galaxies. The Milky Way is a disk-shaped system, with a diameter of between 80,000 and 100,000 light-years and a thickness of about 2,000 light-years, containing more than 10^11 stars. The stars are divided into two main categories, Population II stars and Population I stars. The core, or nucleus, of the Galaxy is surrounded by an ellipsoidal central bulge that measures some 15,000 light-years in diameter and about 6,000 light-years in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Surrounding the bulge and extending in a near spherical distribution above and below the Galactic plane is the Galactic halo. The halo contains about 200 globular clusters and an extremely thinly scattered population of individual stars. The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25,000 light-years. In common with other stars, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk, where bright young stars, H II regions, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments, one of which, the Orion arm, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar, about twice as long as it is wide, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center, or nucleus, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission, called Sagittarius A, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars, it seems likely that the balance (about 2.5 million solar masses) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy.spiral-galaxies, local-groupSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1054Related#milky-way-galaxy-physics#magellanic-clouds#oort-constantsmilky-way-galaxy-fountains (Preliminary)Milky Way Galaxy fountainsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1055Related#galaxy-fountainsmilky-way-galaxy-physics (Preliminary)Milky Way Galaxy physicsgalaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1056Related#milky-way-galaxyNarrowergalactic-bulgegalactic-archaeologymilky-way-stellar-halomilky-way-formationmilky-way-dynamicsmilky-way-magnetic-fieldsgalactic-centergalactic-anticentersolar-neighborhoodgalactic-abundancesmilky-way-diskmilky-way-evolutiongalactic-windsmilky-way-galaxy-fountainsmilky-way-dark-matter-halomilky-way-massgould-beltmilky-way-rotationmilky-way-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Milky Way magnetic fieldsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1057Related#galaxy-magnetic-fieldsmilky-way-mass (Preliminary)Milky Way massmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1058Related#galaxy-massesmilky-way-rotation (Preliminary)Milky Way rotationmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1059Related#galaxy-rotationmilky-way-stellar-halo (Preliminary)Milky Way stellar halomilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1060Related#galaxy-stellar-halosmillimeter-astronomy (Preliminary)Millimeter astronomyradio-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1061millisecond-pulsars (Preliminary)Millisecond pulsarspulsarsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1062mini-neptunes (Preliminary)Mini NeptunesexoplanetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1063minimum-chi-squared (Preliminary)Minimum chi-squaredregressionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1947minimum-spanning-tree (Preliminary)Minimum spanning treespatial-point-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1950Related#single-linkage-hierarchical-clusteringminor-axis (Preliminary)Minor axisThe axis of an ellipse that is perpendicular to the major axis at a point equidistant from the foci.elliptical-orbitsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1064mira-variable-stars (Preliminary)Mira variable starslong-period-variable-stars, late-type-giant-stars, emission-line-stars, pulsating-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1066Related#me-starsmissing-mass (Preliminary)Missing massThe unseen mass whose gravitational influence is needed to account for the way galaxies rotate, and also to bind clusters of galaxies together.

The equatorial radius of Neptune is 24,764 km (3.883 Earths), its semi-major axis is 30.11 astronomical units (4.50 x 10^9 km), and its orbital period is 164.8 yr. Neptune has at least 14 moons, the largest ones are Triton, Proteus, and Nereid, whereas its smaller moons are: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso. Neptune has an incredibly thick atmosphere comprised of 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, and approximately 1% methane. Particles of icy methane in its upper atmosphere give Neptune its deep blue color. Large storms whirl through Neptune's upper atmosphere, and high-speed winds track around the planet at up 600 m/s, fastest recorded in the solar system. One of the largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. Called the Great Dark Spot, it lasted about five years. Neptune has a very thin collection of rings.

The effective temperatures of these stars range from about 30,000 K to 50,000 K, their luminosities from 50,000 to 1,000,000 times that of solar luminosity, and their masses from about 20 to 100 solar masses. The hottest O-type stars display high ionization emission features such as N III and He II, Of star. They are divided into subtypes O2, the hottest, to O9.7, the coldest. O-type stars are relatively rare, for each star of 100 solar masses there are 10^6 stars of solar mass. They are relatively short-lived since they spend only a few million years on the main sequence.

Historically, Of stars were considered to belong to the peculiar category, hence the f notation (see below). In his thesis work, Walborn removed them from that category and established them as the normal O-type supergiants. He also used the notation ((f)), (f), and f to describe the progression from strong He II 4686 absorption, through weakened/absent, to emission, respectively, correlated with increasing N III emission strength, subsequently showing that it is a luminosity sequence -- the first such for stars earlier than O9.o-stars, early-type-emission-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1155ogle-small-amplitude-red-giant-stars (Preliminary)OGLE small amplitude red giant starsred-giant-stars, long-period-variable-stars, multi-periodic-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2123oh-ir-stars (Preliminary)OH/IR starsAn evolved Mira-type star which is associated with strong OH maser and strong infrared (IR) emission from the surrounding shell of warm gas and dust.giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1156Related#infrared-sources#cocoon-stars#hydroxyl-sourcesoort-cloud (Preliminary)Oort cloudA huge theoretical cloud of comets surrounding the Sun between about 50,000 and 100,000 astronomical units and thought to be the reservoir of long-period comets entering the inner solar system.long-period-comets, solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1157Narroweroort-cloud-objectsoort-cloud-objects (Preliminary)Oort cloud objectsoort-cloudSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1158oort-constants (Preliminary)Oort constantsTwo parameters, denoted A and B, that describe the major features of our Galaxy's differential rotation in the Sun's neighbourhood.

NO/NH,defined as the relative abundance of oxygen:,"In practice, the metallicity of stars is usually expressed by the number ratio of iron atoms to hydrogen atoms per unit volume, with respect to the solar values: [Fe/H] = log10(NFe/NH)star - log10(NFe/NH)Sun, where NFe and NH are the numbers of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume. In fact it is taken to be equal to the iron abundance with respect to the solar value. The solar logarithmic iron abundance is 7.50 ± 0.04, with respect to that of hydrogen which, by convention, is 12.00. Stellar metallicity is often expressed in mass fraction. Nebular metallicity is often defined as the relative abundance of oxygen: (NO/NH)neb/(NO/NH)Sun, where N_O and N_H represent the numbers of oxygen and hydrogen atoms per unit volume.chemical-abundancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1031meteor-radiants (Preliminary)Meteor radiantsmeteor-showersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1033meteor-showers (Preliminary)Meteor showersAn increased number of meteors all appearing to diverge from the direction of a single point, called radiant. Meteor showers occur annually on the same dates, when the Earth crosses through a meteoroid stream. Meteor showers are named after the constellation in which the radiant is located. For example, the Perseids's radiant lies near the top of the constellation Perseus. Most meteor showers are caused by comets. As a comet orbits the Sun it sheds an icy, dusty debris stream along its orbit. When the Earth's orbit intersects the dust trail, more meteors are seen as the cometary debris encounters our planet's atmosphere. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scattered by orbiting asteroids. Typical meteor showers show 15 to 100 meteors per hour at their peak. On very rare occasions, during a meteor storm, thousands of meteors fall per hour. Prominent meteor showers are: Quadrantids, Lyrids, Eta Aquariids, Delta Aquariids, Perseids, Orionids, Taurids, Leonids, Geminids, Ursids, Alpha Capricornids.meteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1034Narrowerzenith-hourly-ratemeteor-radiantsmeteor-streams (Preliminary)Meteor streamsThe meteoroids distributed all along an orbit and diffused somewhat around it.meteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1035meteor-trails (Preliminary)Meteor trailsmeteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1036meteorite-composition (Preliminary)Meteorite compositionmeteoritesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1037meteorites (Preliminary)MeteoritesAn object of extraterrestrial origin that survives entry through the atmosphere to reach the Earth's surface.

Meteors are also referred to as shooting stars. Very bright meteors are called fireball or bolide. Most of visible meteors arise from particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams. The brilliant flash of light from a meteor is mainly caused by the meteoroid's high level of kinetic energy as it collides with the atmosphere at high speeds (11-72 km/s). The increase in the number of meteors visible toward the end of the night results from the fact that the Earth rotates about its axis in the same direction as it orbits the Sun. This means that the leading edge (morning side) of the Earth encounters more meteoroids than the trailing edge (evening side). In general, 2 to 3 times as many meteors can be seen in the hour or so just before morning twilight, than can be seen in the early evening. Moreover, the numbers of random, or sporadic, meteors vary from season to season, due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis and other factors.meteoroidsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1041Related#meteoritesNarrowerfireballsmeteor-showersmeteor-trailsmeteor-streamsmethane (Preliminary)MethaneA colorless, odorless, inflammable gas of formula CH4; the simplest hydrocarbon.greenhouse-gasesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1042metropolis-hastings (Preliminary)Metropolis-Hastingsmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1893meyer-group (Preliminary)Meyer groupsunskirtersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2200michelson-interferometers (Preliminary)Michelson interferometersinterferometersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1044Related#michelson-interferometrymichelson-interferometry (Preliminary)Michelson interferometryoptical-phase-shifting-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1045Related#michelson-interferometersmicrogravity (Preliminary)MicrogravityThe state or condition where the force of gravity is very weak, e.g. the weightlessness experienced inside an orbiting spacecraft.space-researchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1046microlensing-event-rate (Preliminary)Microlensing event rategravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2146microlensing-optical-depth (Preliminary)Microlensing optical depthgravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2145microlensing-parallax (Preliminary)Microlensing parallaxgravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2144Related#parallaxNarrowerannual-microlensing-parallaxsatellite-microlensing-parallaxtopocentric-microlensing-parallaxmicrometeorites (Preliminary)MicrometeoritesA small grain sized meteorite which can only be positively identified under the microscope.meteoritesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1047micrometeoroids (Preliminary)MicrometeoroidsmeteoroidsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1048milky-way-dark-matter-halo (Preliminary)Milky Way dark matter halomilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1049Related#galaxy-dark-matter-halosmilky-way-disk (Preliminary)Milky Way diskmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1050Related#galaxy-disksmilky-way-dynamics (Preliminary)Milky Way dynamicsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1051Related#galaxy-dynamicsmilky-way-evolution (Preliminary)Milky Way evolutionmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1052Related#galaxy-evolutionmilky-way-formation (Preliminary)Milky Way formationmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1053Related#galaxy-formationmilky-way-galaxy (Preliminary)Milky Way GalaxyA spiral galaxy, of which the solar system is a small part. It is the second largest in our Local Group of galaxies. The Milky Way is a disk-shaped system, with a diameter of between 80,000 and 100,000 light-years and a thickness of about 2,000 light-years, containing more than 10^11 stars. The stars are divided into two main categories, Population II stars and Population I stars. The core, or nucleus, of the Galaxy is surrounded by an ellipsoidal central bulge that measures some 15,000 light-years in diameter and about 6,000 light-years in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Surrounding the bulge and extending in a near spherical distribution above and below the Galactic plane is the Galactic halo. The halo contains about 200 globular clusters and an extremely thinly scattered population of individual stars. The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25,000 light-years. In common with other stars, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk, where bright young stars, H II regions, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments, one of which, the Orion arm, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar, about twice as long as it is wide, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center, or nucleus, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission, called Sagittarius A, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars, it seems likely that the balance (about 2.5 million solar masses) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy.spiral-galaxies, local-groupSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1054Related#milky-way-galaxy-physics#magellanic-clouds#oort-constantsmilky-way-galaxy-fountains (Preliminary)Milky Way Galaxy fountainsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1055Related#galaxy-fountainsmilky-way-galaxy-physics (Preliminary)Milky Way Galaxy physicsgalaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1056Related#milky-way-galaxyNarrowergalactic-bulgegalactic-archaeologymilky-way-stellar-halomilky-way-formationmilky-way-dynamicsmilky-way-magnetic-fieldsgalactic-centergalactic-anticentersolar-neighborhoodgalactic-abundancesmilky-way-diskmilky-way-evolutiongalactic-windsmilky-way-galaxy-fountainsmilky-way-dark-matter-halomilky-way-massgould-beltmilky-way-rotationmilky-way-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Milky Way magnetic fieldsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1057Related#galaxy-magnetic-fieldsmilky-way-mass (Preliminary)Milky Way massmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1058Related#galaxy-massesmilky-way-rotation (Preliminary)Milky Way rotationmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1059Related#galaxy-rotationmilky-way-stellar-halo (Preliminary)Milky Way stellar halomilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1060Related#galaxy-stellar-halosmillimeter-astronomy (Preliminary)Millimeter astronomyradio-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1061millisecond-pulsars (Preliminary)Millisecond pulsarspulsarsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1062mini-neptunes (Preliminary)Mini NeptunesexoplanetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1063minimum-chi-squared (Preliminary)Minimum chi-squaredregressionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1947minimum-spanning-tree (Preliminary)Minimum spanning treespatial-point-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1950Related#single-linkage-hierarchical-clusteringminor-axis (Preliminary)Minor axisThe axis of an ellipse that is perpendicular to the major axis at a point equidistant from the foci.elliptical-orbitsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1064mira-variable-stars (Preliminary)Mira variable starslong-period-variable-stars, late-type-giant-stars, emission-line-stars, pulsating-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1066Related#me-starsmissing-mass (Preliminary)Missing massThe unseen mass whose gravitational influence is needed to account for the way galaxies rotate, and also to bind clusters of galaxies together.

The equatorial radius of Neptune is 24,764 km (3.883 Earths), its semi-major axis is 30.11 astronomical units (4.50 x 10^9 km), and its orbital period is 164.8 yr. Neptune has at least 14 moons, the largest ones are Triton, Proteus, and Nereid, whereas its smaller moons are: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso. Neptune has an incredibly thick atmosphere comprised of 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, and approximately 1% methane. Particles of icy methane in its upper atmosphere give Neptune its deep blue color. Large storms whirl through Neptune's upper atmosphere, and high-speed winds track around the planet at up 600 m/s, fastest recorded in the solar system. One of the largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. Called the Great Dark Spot, it lasted about five years. Neptune has a very thin collection of rings.

IR,maser and strong infrared,"In practice, the metallicity of stars is usually expressed by the number ratio of iron atoms to hydrogen atoms per unit volume, with respect to the solar values: [Fe/H] = log10(NFe/NH)star - log10(NFe/NH)Sun, where NFe and NH are the numbers of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume. In fact it is taken to be equal to the iron abundance with respect to the solar value. The solar logarithmic iron abundance is 7.50 ± 0.04, with respect to that of hydrogen which, by convention, is 12.00. Stellar metallicity is often expressed in mass fraction. Nebular metallicity is often defined as the relative abundance of oxygen: (NO/NH)neb/(NO/NH)Sun, where N_O and N_H represent the numbers of oxygen and hydrogen atoms per unit volume.chemical-abundancesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1031meteor-radiants (Preliminary)Meteor radiantsmeteor-showersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1033meteor-showers (Preliminary)Meteor showersAn increased number of meteors all appearing to diverge from the direction of a single point, called radiant. Meteor showers occur annually on the same dates, when the Earth crosses through a meteoroid stream. Meteor showers are named after the constellation in which the radiant is located. For example, the Perseids's radiant lies near the top of the constellation Perseus. Most meteor showers are caused by comets. As a comet orbits the Sun it sheds an icy, dusty debris stream along its orbit. When the Earth's orbit intersects the dust trail, more meteors are seen as the cometary debris encounters our planet's atmosphere. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scattered by orbiting asteroids. Typical meteor showers show 15 to 100 meteors per hour at their peak. On very rare occasions, during a meteor storm, thousands of meteors fall per hour. Prominent meteor showers are: Quadrantids, Lyrids, Eta Aquariids, Delta Aquariids, Perseids, Orionids, Taurids, Leonids, Geminids, Ursids, Alpha Capricornids.meteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1034Narrowerzenith-hourly-ratemeteor-radiantsmeteor-streams (Preliminary)Meteor streamsThe meteoroids distributed all along an orbit and diffused somewhat around it.meteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1035meteor-trails (Preliminary)Meteor trailsmeteorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1036meteorite-composition (Preliminary)Meteorite compositionmeteoritesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1037meteorites (Preliminary)MeteoritesAn object of extraterrestrial origin that survives entry through the atmosphere to reach the Earth's surface.

Meteors are also referred to as shooting stars. Very bright meteors are called fireball or bolide. Most of visible meteors arise from particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams. The brilliant flash of light from a meteor is mainly caused by the meteoroid's high level of kinetic energy as it collides with the atmosphere at high speeds (11-72 km/s). The increase in the number of meteors visible toward the end of the night results from the fact that the Earth rotates about its axis in the same direction as it orbits the Sun. This means that the leading edge (morning side) of the Earth encounters more meteoroids than the trailing edge (evening side). In general, 2 to 3 times as many meteors can be seen in the hour or so just before morning twilight, than can be seen in the early evening. Moreover, the numbers of random, or sporadic, meteors vary from season to season, due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis and other factors.meteoroidsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1041Related#meteoritesNarrowerfireballsmeteor-showersmeteor-trailsmeteor-streamsmethane (Preliminary)MethaneA colorless, odorless, inflammable gas of formula CH4; the simplest hydrocarbon.greenhouse-gasesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1042metropolis-hastings (Preliminary)Metropolis-Hastingsmarkov-chain-monte-carloSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1893meyer-group (Preliminary)Meyer groupsunskirtersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2200michelson-interferometers (Preliminary)Michelson interferometersinterferometersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1044Related#michelson-interferometrymichelson-interferometry (Preliminary)Michelson interferometryoptical-phase-shifting-interferometrySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1045Related#michelson-interferometersmicrogravity (Preliminary)MicrogravityThe state or condition where the force of gravity is very weak, e.g. the weightlessness experienced inside an orbiting spacecraft.space-researchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1046microlensing-event-rate (Preliminary)Microlensing event rategravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2146microlensing-optical-depth (Preliminary)Microlensing optical depthgravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2145microlensing-parallax (Preliminary)Microlensing parallaxgravitational-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2144Related#parallaxNarrowerannual-microlensing-parallaxsatellite-microlensing-parallaxtopocentric-microlensing-parallaxmicrometeorites (Preliminary)MicrometeoritesA small grain sized meteorite which can only be positively identified under the microscope.meteoritesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1047micrometeoroids (Preliminary)MicrometeoroidsmeteoroidsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1048milky-way-dark-matter-halo (Preliminary)Milky Way dark matter halomilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1049Related#galaxy-dark-matter-halosmilky-way-disk (Preliminary)Milky Way diskmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1050Related#galaxy-disksmilky-way-dynamics (Preliminary)Milky Way dynamicsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1051Related#galaxy-dynamicsmilky-way-evolution (Preliminary)Milky Way evolutionmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1052Related#galaxy-evolutionmilky-way-formation (Preliminary)Milky Way formationmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1053Related#galaxy-formationmilky-way-galaxy (Preliminary)Milky Way GalaxyA spiral galaxy, of which the solar system is a small part. It is the second largest in our Local Group of galaxies. The Milky Way is a disk-shaped system, with a diameter of between 80,000 and 100,000 light-years and a thickness of about 2,000 light-years, containing more than 10^11 stars. The stars are divided into two main categories, Population II stars and Population I stars. The core, or nucleus, of the Galaxy is surrounded by an ellipsoidal central bulge that measures some 15,000 light-years in diameter and about 6,000 light-years in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Surrounding the bulge and extending in a near spherical distribution above and below the Galactic plane is the Galactic halo. The halo contains about 200 globular clusters and an extremely thinly scattered population of individual stars. The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25,000 light-years. In common with other stars, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk, where bright young stars, H II regions, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments, one of which, the Orion arm, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar, about twice as long as it is wide, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center, or nucleus, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission, called Sagittarius A, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars, it seems likely that the balance (about 2.5 million solar masses) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy.spiral-galaxies, local-groupSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1054Related#milky-way-galaxy-physics#magellanic-clouds#oort-constantsmilky-way-galaxy-fountains (Preliminary)Milky Way Galaxy fountainsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1055Related#galaxy-fountainsmilky-way-galaxy-physics (Preliminary)Milky Way Galaxy physicsgalaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1056Related#milky-way-galaxyNarrowergalactic-bulgegalactic-archaeologymilky-way-stellar-halomilky-way-formationmilky-way-dynamicsmilky-way-magnetic-fieldsgalactic-centergalactic-anticentersolar-neighborhoodgalactic-abundancesmilky-way-diskmilky-way-evolutiongalactic-windsmilky-way-galaxy-fountainsmilky-way-dark-matter-halomilky-way-massgould-beltmilky-way-rotationmilky-way-magnetic-fields (Preliminary)Milky Way magnetic fieldsmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1057Related#galaxy-magnetic-fieldsmilky-way-mass (Preliminary)Milky Way massmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1058Related#galaxy-massesmilky-way-rotation (Preliminary)Milky Way rotationmilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1059Related#galaxy-rotationmilky-way-stellar-halo (Preliminary)Milky Way stellar halomilky-way-galaxy-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1060Related#galaxy-stellar-halosmillimeter-astronomy (Preliminary)Millimeter astronomyradio-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1061millisecond-pulsars (Preliminary)Millisecond pulsarspulsarsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1062mini-neptunes (Preliminary)Mini NeptunesexoplanetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1063minimum-chi-squared (Preliminary)Minimum chi-squaredregressionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1947minimum-spanning-tree (Preliminary)Minimum spanning treespatial-point-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1950Related#single-linkage-hierarchical-clusteringminor-axis (Preliminary)Minor axisThe axis of an ellipse that is perpendicular to the major axis at a point equidistant from the foci.elliptical-orbitsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1064mira-variable-stars (Preliminary)Mira variable starslong-period-variable-stars, late-type-giant-stars, emission-line-stars, pulsating-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1066Related#me-starsmissing-mass (Preliminary)Missing massThe unseen mass whose gravitational influence is needed to account for the way galaxies rotate, and also to bind clusters of galaxies together.

The equatorial radius of Neptune is 24,764 km (3.883 Earths), its semi-major axis is 30.11 astronomical units (4.50 x 10^9 km), and its orbital period is 164.8 yr. Neptune has at least 14 moons, the largest ones are Triton, Proteus, and Nereid, whereas its smaller moons are: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso. Neptune has an incredibly thick atmosphere comprised of 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, and approximately 1% methane. Particles of icy methane in its upper atmosphere give Neptune its deep blue color. Large storms whirl through Neptune's upper atmosphere, and high-speed winds track around the planet at up 600 m/s, fastest recorded in the solar system. One of the largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. Called the Great Dark Spot, it lasted about five years. Neptune has a very thin collection of rings.

This is the earliest spectral type and the only main sequence star in which ionized helium is present. The effective temperatures of these stars range from about 30,000 K to 50,000 K, their luminosities from 50,000 to 1,000,000 times that of solar luminosity, and their masses from about 20 to 100 solar masses. The hottest O-type stars display high ionization emission features such as N III and He II, Of star. They are divided into subtypes O2, the hottest, to O9.7, the coldest. O-type stars are relatively rare, for each star of 100 solar masses there are 10^6 stars of solar mass. They are relatively short-lived since they spend only a few million years on the main sequence.

Historically, Of stars were considered to belong to the peculiar category, hence the f notation (see below). In his thesis work, Walborn removed them from that category and established them as the normal O-type supergiants. He also used the notation ((f)), (f), and f to describe the progression from strong He II 4686 absorption, through weakened/absent, to emission, respectively, correlated with increasing N III emission strength, subsequently showing that it is a luminosity sequence -- the first such for stars earlier than O9.o-stars, early-type-emission-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1155ogle-small-amplitude-red-giant-stars (Preliminary)OGLE small amplitude red giant starsred-giant-stars, long-period-variable-stars, multi-periodic-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2123oh-ir-stars (Preliminary)OH/IR starsAn evolved Mira-type star which is associated with strong OH maser and strong infrared (IR) emission from the surrounding shell of warm gas and dust.giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1156Related#infrared-sources#cocoon-stars#hydroxyl-sourcesoort-cloud (Preliminary)Oort cloudA huge theoretical cloud of comets surrounding the Sun between about 50,000 and 100,000 astronomical units and thought to be the reservoir of long-period comets entering the inner solar system.long-period-comets, solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1157Narroweroort-cloud-objectsoort-cloud-objects (Preliminary)Oort cloud objectsoort-cloudSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1158oort-constants (Preliminary)Oort constantsTwo parameters, denoted A and B, that describe the major features of our Galaxy's differential rotation in the Sun's neighbourhood.

Such a surface exists only near sufficiently compact objects where the curvature of space-time is very important. In other words, a body can take a stable orbit around a black hole provided that it moves with the speed of light. However, only photons can have such a velocity; hence the term 'photon sphere.' For a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, the photon sphere has a radius of R = 3GM/c2 = 3 RS/2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, c is the speed of light, and RS is the Schwarzschild radius. For a rotating, Kerr black hole, the situation is much more complex due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In that case circular paths exist for radii whose values depend on the rotation direction. More specifically, in the equatorial plane there are two possible circular light paths: a smaller one in the direction of the rotation, and a larger one in the opposite direction.black-hole-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1236photovisual-magnitude (Preliminary)Photovisual magnitudeMagnitude defined for the combination of a photographic plate and a yellow filter, approximating the spectral sensitivity of the eye.apparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1238pickup-ions (Preliminary)Pickup ionsinterplanetary-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1239plages (Preliminary)PlagesA bright cloud-like feature that appears in the vicinity of a sunspot.

Pluto revolves around the Sun in a highly elliptical orbit at a mean distance of 39.5 astronomical units once every about 248 years. The orbit eccentricity is 0.25 (compare with the Earth's 0.02) yielding a perihelion distance of 29.66 astronomical units and an aphelion distance of 48.87 AU. Its orbital inclination is 17 degrees, which is much higher than those of the other planets. Pluto's mass is 1.308 x 10^22 kg, that is 0.00218 Earth mass (0.177 Moon mass), its equatorial radius is 0.19 Earth radius, and its rotation period is equal to 6.39 Earth days. It has five known satellites, in order of distance from Pluto: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto's radius is estimated to be about 1150 km (0.18 Earths). Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's satellites (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan, and Triton). Pluto's surface has an estimated temperature of 37.5 K and is composed of more than 98% nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.dwarf-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1267plutoids (Preliminary)Plutoidstrans-neptunian-objectsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1268plutonian-satellites (Preliminary)Plutonian satellitesnatural-satellites-solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2202pogson-scale (Preliminary)Pogson scaleapparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1269pointing-accuracy (Preliminary)Pointing accuracyastronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1271Narrowerpointing-errorpointing-error (Preliminary)Pointing errorpointing-accuracySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1272poisson-distribution (Preliminary)Poisson distributionA probability function that characterizes discrete random events occurring independently of one another within some definite time or space.

The material from which these stars formed consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium. Because neutral hydrogen clouds were free of dust, their cooling mechanism was drastically ineffective. As a result, these star forming clouds had a much higher temperature than in the present epoch, and their Jeans mass was much higher. Therefore, these first generation of stars were principally massive, with a typical mass scale of order of about 100 M_sun. Population III stars started forming about 300 million years after the Big Bang at redshifts between 50 and 6, when the Universe had between 1 and 5% of its present age. These stars were probably responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Given their high mass, they lived only a few million years ending with either a pair-instability supernova phase or a direct collapse to a black hole. Population III stars thus initiated the chemical enrichment of the Universe and opened the way to more normal modes of star formation, namely Population II. Some models predict a bimodal initial mass function for the first stars, allowing also for solar mass stars.stellar-populationsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1285position-angle (Preliminary)Position angleThe convention for measuring angles on the sky in astronomy (abbreviated as PA).

Protoplanetary disks are remnants of accretion disks which bring forth stars. Typically, their sizes are ~100-500 AU, masses ~10^-2 solar masses, lifetimes ~10^6 - 10^7 years, and accretion rates ~10^-7 - 10^-8 solar masses per year. According to the standard theory of planet formation, called core accretion, planets come into being by the growth of dust grains which stick together and produce ever larger bodies, known as planetesimals. The agglomeration of these planetesimals of 100 to 1000 km in size into rocky Earth-mass planets is the main outcome of this theory. Beyond the snow line in the disk, if the masses of these cores of rock and ice grow higher than 10 times that of Earth in less than a few million years, gas can rapidly accrete and give rise to giant gaseous planets similar to Jupiter. If core building goes on too slowly, the disk gas dissipates before the formation of giant planets can start. Finally the left-over planetesimals that could not agglomerate into rocky planets or core of giant planets remain as a debris disk around the central object that has become a main sequence star. An alternative to core accretion theory is formation of planets in a massive protoplanetary disk by gravitational instabilities. The validity of these two theories is presently debated.planetary-system-formation, interplanetary-medium, protostars, circumstellar-disksSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1300Related#planet-formationNarrowerproplydsplanetesimalsprotoplanetary-nebulae (Preliminary)Protoplanetary nebulaeA short-lived transition object between the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and planetary nebula phases.nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1301protostars (Preliminary)ProtostarsA stage in the process of star formation, after the gravitational collapse of the dense pre-stellar core and before the initiation of nuclear fusion in the central object which will eventually become a star.

As the magnetic axis and hence the beam are inclined to the rotation axis, a pulse is seen every time the rotation brings the magnetic pole region of the neutron star into view. In this way the pulsar acts much as a light house does, sweeping a beam of radiation through space. The pulse or spin periods range from 1.4 milliseconds to 8.5 seconds. As neutron stars concentrate an average of 1.4 solar masses on a diameter of only 20 km, pulsars are exceedingly dense and compact, representing the densest matter in the observable Universe. The pulsar radiation, chiefly emitted in radio frequencies (0.1-1 GHz), is highly polarized. The exact mechanism by which a pulsar radiates is still a matter of vigorous investigation. Simply put, an enormous electric field is induced by the rotation of a magnetized neutron star. The force of this field exceeds gravity by ten to twelve orders of magnitudes. Charged particles are whereby pulled out from the stellar surface resulting in a dense, magnetized plasma that surrounds the pulsar (magnetosphere). The charged particles flow out of the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star, following the open magnetic field lines. The acceleration of the charged particles along the curved magnetic field lines will cause them to radiate.neutron-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1306Narrowerbinary-pulsarsoptical-pulsarsrotation-powered-pulsarsradio-pulsarsmillisecond-pulsarspulsating-variable-stars (Preliminary)Pulsating variable starsA type of variable star that changes its brightness by changing its volume through expansion and contraction.

Pulsation may occur in a single mode or in multiple modes, depending on the type of star. Three different modes of pulsations have been detected through the helioseismology of the Sun: p mode, g mode, and f mode, generated by acoustic, gravity, and surface gravity waves respectively.stellar-pulsationsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1309purkinje-effect (Preliminary)Purkinje effectThe increasing sensibility of the retina for light of shorter wavelength as the brightness decreases.

Quintessence can have several types and differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In modern physics, the four known ""elements"" are the baryons (proton, neutron, etc.), the leptons (neutrinos, electrons, etc.), the photon, and the hypothetical non-baryonic matter, which is thought to be 80% of the total matter in the Universe. The quintessence field is a possibility which can be confirmed or disproved by measurements of the dark energy value at different redshifts. In some models, the quintessence is fine-tuned to explain both the cosmological constant problem and the inflation in the very early Universe.dark-energySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1323r-associations (Preliminary)R associationsA stellar association containing a number of reflection nebulae.

Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted their hydrogen fuel in the core. They may have a luminosity up to 1000 times greater than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. Red giants belong to the luminosity class III or II (bright giants). They are luminous because of their great size, but have a relatively low surface temperature. All normal stars are expected to pass eventually through a red-giant phase as a consequence of stellar evolution. When a main sequence star has converted approximately 10% of its hydrogen to helium, nuclear reactions in the core stop (Schönberg-Chandrasekhar limit). The hydrostatic equilibrium is no longer maintained, and the core contracts while the outer layers expand and cool. This process produces the low surface temperature and large size (from 10 to 100 times that of the Sun) that characterize the red giant. In the core the temperature continues to rise. When it approaches 100,000,000 K helium will begin to fuse into carbon. Prominent bright red giants in the night sky include Aldebaran and Arcturus.giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1372Related#cocoon-stars#red-giant-branchNarrowerogle-small-amplitude-red-giant-starsred-straggler-starsred-giant-tip (Preliminary)Red giant tipred-giant-branchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1371red-noise (Preliminary)Red noisetime-series-analysisSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1956red-sequence-galaxies (Preliminary)Red sequence galaxiesgalaxy-colorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1373red-straggler-stars (Preliminary)Red straggler starsred-giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1374red-supergiant-stars (Preliminary)Red supergiant starsA supergiant star with spectral type K or M.

At only 50,000 light years distant from our Galaxy's core, it is travelling in a polar orbit around the Galaxy. Our Galaxy is slowly devouring it, as evidenced by a filament which stretches around the Milky Way's core like a gossamer loop. It is only about 10,000 light-years in diameter, in comparison to the Milky Way's diameter of 100,000 light years. It is populated by old yellowish stars has four known globular clusters: M54, Arp 2, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8.

When two eclipses are separated by a period of one Saros, they occur at the same node with the Moon at nearly the same distance from Earth and at the same time of year. Thus, the Saros is a useful tool for organizing eclipses into families or series. Each series typically lasts 12 or 13 centuries and contains 70 or more eclipses.lunar-eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1424satellite-formation (Preliminary)Natural satellite formationplanetary-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1425Related#natural-satellites-solar-systemsatellite-microlensing-parallax (Preliminary)Satellite microlensing parallaxmicrolensing-parallaxSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2148saturn (Preliminary)SaturnThe sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest with an equatorial diameter of 120,536 km orbiting at an average distance of 1,429,400,000 km (9.54 astronomical units) from Sun. With an eccentricity of 0.05555, its distance from the Sun ranges from 1.35 billion km (9.024 AU) at its perihelion to 1.509 billion km (10.086 AU) at its aphelion. Its average orbital speed being 9.69 km/s, it takes Saturn 29.457 Earth years (or 10,759 Earth days) to complete a single revolution around the Sun. However, Saturn also takes just over 10 and a half hours (10 hours 33 minutes) to rotate once on its axis. This means that a single year on Saturn lasts about 24,491 Saturnian solar days. Saturn has a mass of 5.6836 x 1026 kg (95.159 Earth masses) and a mean density of 0.687 g cm^(-3). Like Jupiter, Saturn is about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium with traces of water, methane, and ammonia, similar to the composition of the primordial Solar Nebula from which the solar system was formed. The temperature on Saturn is ~ -185 °C. Like Jupiter, Saturn has a solid core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). The core has an estimated mass of 9-22 Earth Masses and a diameter of about 25,000 km (about 2 Earth diameter). The core is enveloped by a liquid metallic hydrogen layer and a molecular hydrogen layer. Saturn's interior is hot (12,000 K at the core). The planet radiates more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Most of the extra energy is generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism as in Jupiter. Saturn has 62 known satellites. Saturn's ring. On 1 July 2004 NASA/ESA's Cassini-Huygens became the first to orbit Saturn, beginning a 13 year mission that revealed many secrets and surprises about Saturn and its system of rings and moons.outer-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1426Related#saturnian-satellitessaturnian-satellites (Preliminary)Saturnian satellitesnatural-satellites-solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1427Related#saturnNarrowertitanscalar-tensor-vector-gravity (Preliminary)Scalar-tensor-vector gravitynon-standard-theories-of-gravitySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1428scale-height (Preliminary)Scale heightThe height within which some parameter, such as pressure or density, decreases by a factor of e.

Such a surface exists only near sufficiently compact objects where the curvature of space-time is very important. In other words, a body can take a stable orbit around a black hole provided that it moves with the speed of light. However, only photons can have such a velocity; hence the term 'photon sphere.' For a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, the photon sphere has a radius of R = 3GM/c2 = 3 RS/2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, c is the speed of light, and RS is the Schwarzschild radius. For a rotating, Kerr black hole, the situation is much more complex due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In that case circular paths exist for radii whose values depend on the rotation direction. More specifically, in the equatorial plane there are two possible circular light paths: a smaller one in the direction of the rotation, and a larger one in the opposite direction.black-hole-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1236photovisual-magnitude (Preliminary)Photovisual magnitudeMagnitude defined for the combination of a photographic plate and a yellow filter, approximating the spectral sensitivity of the eye.apparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1238pickup-ions (Preliminary)Pickup ionsinterplanetary-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1239plages (Preliminary)PlagesA bright cloud-like feature that appears in the vicinity of a sunspot.

The orbit eccentricity is 0.25 (compare with the Earth's 0.02) yielding a perihelion distance of 29.66 astronomical units and an aphelion distance of 48.87 AU. Its orbital inclination is 17 degrees, which is much higher than those of the other planets. Pluto's mass is 1.308 x 10^22 kg, that is 0.00218 Earth mass (0.177 Moon mass), its equatorial radius is 0.19 Earth radius, and its rotation period is equal to 6.39 Earth days. It has five known satellites, in order of distance from Pluto: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto's radius is estimated to be about 1150 km (0.18 Earths). Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's satellites (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan, and Triton). Pluto's surface has an estimated temperature of 37.5 K and is composed of more than 98% nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.dwarf-planetsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1267plutoids (Preliminary)Plutoidstrans-neptunian-objectsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1268plutonian-satellites (Preliminary)Plutonian satellitesnatural-satellites-solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2202pogson-scale (Preliminary)Pogson scaleapparent-magnitudeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1269pointing-accuracy (Preliminary)Pointing accuracyastronomical-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1271Narrowerpointing-errorpointing-error (Preliminary)Pointing errorpointing-accuracySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1272poisson-distribution (Preliminary)Poisson distributionA probability function that characterizes discrete random events occurring independently of one another within some definite time or space.

The material from which these stars formed consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium. Because neutral hydrogen clouds were free of dust, their cooling mechanism was drastically ineffective. As a result, these star forming clouds had a much higher temperature than in the present epoch, and their Jeans mass was much higher. Therefore, these first generation of stars were principally massive, with a typical mass scale of order of about 100 M_sun. Population III stars started forming about 300 million years after the Big Bang at redshifts between 50 and 6, when the Universe had between 1 and 5% of its present age. These stars were probably responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Given their high mass, they lived only a few million years ending with either a pair-instability supernova phase or a direct collapse to a black hole. Population III stars thus initiated the chemical enrichment of the Universe and opened the way to more normal modes of star formation, namely Population II. Some models predict a bimodal initial mass function for the first stars, allowing also for solar mass stars.stellar-populationsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1285position-angle (Preliminary)Position angleThe convention for measuring angles on the sky in astronomy (abbreviated as PA).

According to the standard theory of planet formation, called core accretion, planets come into being by the growth of dust grains which stick together and produce ever larger bodies, known as planetesimals. The agglomeration of these planetesimals of 100 to 1000 km in size into rocky Earth-mass planets is the main outcome of this theory. Beyond the snow line in the disk, if the masses of these cores of rock and ice grow higher than 10 times that of Earth in less than a few million years, gas can rapidly accrete and give rise to giant gaseous planets similar to Jupiter. If core building goes on too slowly, the disk gas dissipates before the formation of giant planets can start. Finally the left-over planetesimals that could not agglomerate into rocky planets or core of giant planets remain as a debris disk around the central object that has become a main sequence star. An alternative to core accretion theory is formation of planets in a massive protoplanetary disk by gravitational instabilities. The validity of these two theories is presently debated.planetary-system-formation, interplanetary-medium, protostars, circumstellar-disksSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1300Related#planet-formationNarrowerproplydsplanetesimalsprotoplanetary-nebulae (Preliminary)Protoplanetary nebulaeA short-lived transition object between the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and planetary nebula phases.nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1301protostars (Preliminary)ProtostarsA stage in the process of star formation, after the gravitational collapse of the dense pre-stellar core and before the initiation of nuclear fusion in the central object which will eventually become a star.

As the magnetic axis and hence the beam are inclined to the rotation axis, a pulse is seen every time the rotation brings the magnetic pole region of the neutron star into view. In this way the pulsar acts much as a light house does, sweeping a beam of radiation through space. The pulse or spin periods range from 1.4 milliseconds to 8.5 seconds. As neutron stars concentrate an average of 1.4 solar masses on a diameter of only 20 km, pulsars are exceedingly dense and compact, representing the densest matter in the observable Universe. The pulsar radiation, chiefly emitted in radio frequencies (0.1-1 GHz), is highly polarized. The exact mechanism by which a pulsar radiates is still a matter of vigorous investigation. Simply put, an enormous electric field is induced by the rotation of a magnetized neutron star. The force of this field exceeds gravity by ten to twelve orders of magnitudes. Charged particles are whereby pulled out from the stellar surface resulting in a dense, magnetized plasma that surrounds the pulsar (magnetosphere). The charged particles flow out of the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star, following the open magnetic field lines. The acceleration of the charged particles along the curved magnetic field lines will cause them to radiate.neutron-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1306Narrowerbinary-pulsarsoptical-pulsarsrotation-powered-pulsarsradio-pulsarsmillisecond-pulsarspulsating-variable-stars (Preliminary)Pulsating variable starsA type of variable star that changes its brightness by changing its volume through expansion and contraction.

Pulsation may occur in a single mode or in multiple modes, depending on the type of star.

Quintessence can have several types and differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In modern physics, the four known ""elements"" are the baryons (proton, neutron, etc.), the leptons (neutrinos, electrons, etc.), the photon, and the hypothetical non-baryonic matter, which is thought to be 80% of the total matter in the Universe. The quintessence field is a possibility which can be confirmed or disproved by measurements of the dark energy value at different redshifts. In some models, the quintessence is fine-tuned to explain both the cosmological constant problem and the inflation in the very early Universe.dark-energySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1323r-associations (Preliminary)R associationsA stellar association containing a number of reflection nebulae.

Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted their hydrogen fuel in the core. They may have a luminosity up to 1000 times greater than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. Red giants belong to the luminosity class III or II (bright giants). They are luminous because of their great size, but have a relatively low surface temperature. All normal stars are expected to pass eventually through a red-giant phase as a consequence of stellar evolution. When a main sequence star has converted approximately 10% of its hydrogen to helium, nuclear reactions in the core stop (Schönberg-Chandrasekhar limit). The hydrostatic equilibrium is no longer maintained, and the core contracts while the outer layers expand and cool. This process produces the low surface temperature and large size (from 10 to 100 times that of the Sun) that characterize the red giant. In the core the temperature continues to rise. When it approaches 100,000,000 K helium will begin to fuse into carbon. Prominent bright red giants in the night sky include Aldebaran and Arcturus.giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1372Related#cocoon-stars#red-giant-branchNarrowerogle-small-amplitude-red-giant-starsred-straggler-starsred-giant-tip (Preliminary)Red giant tipred-giant-branchSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1371red-noise (Preliminary)Red noisetime-series-analysisSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1956red-sequence-galaxies (Preliminary)Red sequence galaxiesgalaxy-colorsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1373red-straggler-stars (Preliminary)Red straggler starsred-giant-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1374red-supergiant-stars (Preliminary)Red supergiant starsA supergiant star with spectral type K or M.

With an eccentricity of 0.05555, its distance from the Sun ranges from 1.35 billion km (9.024 AU) at its perihelion to 1.509 billion km (10.086 AU) at its aphelion. Its average orbital speed being 9.69 km/s, it takes Saturn 29.457 Earth years (or 10,759 Earth days) to complete a single revolution around the Sun. However, Saturn also takes just over 10 and a half hours (10 hours 33 minutes) to rotate once on its axis. This means that a single year on Saturn lasts about 24,491 Saturnian solar days. Saturn has a mass of 5.6836 x 1026 kg (95.159 Earth masses) and a mean density of 0.687 g cm^(-3). Like Jupiter, Saturn is about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium with traces of water, methane, and ammonia, similar to the composition of the primordial Solar Nebula from which the solar system was formed. The temperature on Saturn is ~ -185 °C. Like Jupiter, Saturn has a solid core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). The core has an estimated mass of 9-22 Earth Masses and a diameter of about 25,000 km (about 2 Earth diameter). The core is enveloped by a liquid metallic hydrogen layer and a molecular hydrogen layer. Saturn's interior is hot (12,000 K at the core). The planet radiates more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Most of the extra energy is generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism as in Jupiter. Saturn has 62 known satellites.

The presence of these emission features, which are not seen in the spectra of normal galaxies, indicates a very high degree of ionization. Moreover, the nucleus radiates non-thermal continuum emission extending over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. It is thought that a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy accretes gas (accretion) from its surrounding environment to power Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies are divided into two types according to the width of their spectral lines. Type 1 Seyfert (Sy 1) galaxies have very broad emission lines (10^3 - 10^4 km s^-1), while Type 2 Seyferts (Sy 2) show relatively narrow lines (several hundred km s^-1). These spectral differences may be the result of viewing the nucleus from different angles. A Type 2 Seyfert galaxy may be a mostly edge-on view of matter spiraling in toward the supermassive black hole, whereas a Type 1 Seyfert provides a more pole-on view, allowing us to see the more turbulent region around the black hole.high-energy-astrophysics, emission-line-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1447shadow-bands (Preliminary)Shadow bandsFaint wavy lines of alternating light and dark that sometimes can be seen on flat, light-colored surfaces just before and just after a total solar eclipse.

As the fuel is progressively exhausted, the shell moves outward until it enters regions too cool for the reactions to continue. For example, after the exhaustion of hydrogen in the core, helium burning might take place in the core with a shell of hydrogen burning surrounding it.

Examples include Saturn's Prometheus and Pandora, which shepherd the narrow outer F ring and the Uranus satellites Cordelia and Ophelia and the epsilon ring. The faster-moving inside satellite accelerates the inner ring particles as it passes them, causing them to spiral out to larger orbits.

Over the course of several hours up to 10,000 billion kg of this material is ejected into interplanetary space with a speed of as high as 3000 km/s. CMEs are most spectacularly observed by a white light coronagraph located outside Earth's atmosphere. Such observations from Skylab in the early 1970's were the first to reveal this phenomenon. CME's disrupt the flow of the solar wind and can produce intense electromagnetic disturbances that can severely damage satellites and disrupt power grids on Earth. When these ejections reach the Earth, they give rise to geomagnetic storms. The frequency varies with the solar cycle; during solar minimum they come at a rate of about one per week, and during maximum there is an average of about two or three per day.solar-stormSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/310Related#stellar-mass-loss#stellar-coronal-mass-ejections#ejectasolar-coronal-plumes (Preliminary)Solar coronal plumesA coronal feature of the Sun, which appears as long, thin streamers that project outward from the Sun's north and south poles.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2039Related#stellar-coronal-plumessolar-coronal-radio-emission (Preliminary)Solar coronal radio emissionsolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1993solar-coronal-seismology (Preliminary)Solar coronal seismologysolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1994solar-coronal-streamers (Preliminary)Solar coronal streamersA bright, narrow stream of particles traveling through the Sun's corona, visible in images taken with a coronagraph or during a total solar eclipse.

Semiregular variables are classified in several subtypes: SRA, SRB, SRC, and SRD.late-type-giant-stars, long-period-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1444Narrowersrc-variable-starssra-variable-starssrb-variable-starssrd-variable-starssrs-variable-starssemimajor-axis (Preliminary)Semimajor axisHalf the length of the major axis of an ellipse; a standard element used to describe an elliptical orbit.elliptical-orbitsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1445semiminor-axis (Preliminary)Semiminor axiselliptical-orbitsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1446seyfert-galaxies (Preliminary)Seyfert galaxiesA member of an important class of active galaxies which are characterized by the presence of an intensely bright nucleus in the optical wavelengths (10^9-10^12 L_sun) displaying emission spectral lines. The presence of these emission features, which are not seen in the spectra of normal galaxies, indicates a very high degree of ionization. Moreover, the nucleus radiates non-thermal continuum emission extending over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. It is thought that a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy accretes gas (accretion) from its surrounding environment to power Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies are divided into two types according to the width of their spectral lines. Type 1 Seyfert (Sy 1) galaxies have very broad emission lines (10^3 - 10^4 km s^-1), while Type 2 Seyferts (Sy 2) show relatively narrow lines (several hundred km s^-1). These spectral differences may be the result of viewing the nucleus from different angles. A Type 2 Seyfert galaxy may be a mostly edge-on view of matter spiraling in toward the supermassive black hole, whereas a Type 1 Seyfert provides a more pole-on view, allowing us to see the more turbulent region around the black hole.high-energy-astrophysics, emission-line-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1447shadow-bands (Preliminary)Shadow bandsFaint wavy lines of alternating light and dark that sometimes can be seen on flat, light-colored surfaces just before and just after a total solar eclipse.

As the fuel is progressively exhausted, the shell moves outward until it enters regions too cool for the reactions to continue. For example, after the exhaustion of hydrogen in the core, helium burning might take place in the core with a shell of hydrogen burning surrounding it. Stars may have more than one region of shell burning during their stellar evolution, each shell with its own nuclear reactions.circumstellar-shellsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1450shell-stars (Preliminary)Shell starsA main-sequence star, usually of spectral class B to F, whose spectrum shows bright emission lines superimposed on the normal absorption lines.

Examples include Saturn's Prometheus and Pandora, which shepherd the narrow outer F ring and the Uranus satellites Cordelia and Ophelia and the epsilon ring. The faster-moving inside satellite accelerates the inner ring particles as it passes them, causing them to spiral out to larger orbits. At the same time the slower-moving outer satellite decelerates the outer ring particles as they pass by, causing them to spiral inward.

The gas density in these areas are very low, about 100 times less than that of coronal active regions. The magnetic field lines in a coronal hole extend out into interplanetary space rather than returning to the Sun's surface, as they do in other parts of the Sun (open magnetic field line). Ionized hot gas can escape easily along such a path, and this brings about high speed solar wind streams.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1484Related#stellar-coronal-holessolar-coronal-lines (Preliminary)Solar coronal linesAn emission line in the spectrum of the solar corona caused by highly ionized metal ions; especially those of iron, such as the red and green lines at 6375 Å and 5303 Å [Fe X] and [Fe XIV], respectively. From their discovery in 1870 until 1939, it was believed that these forbidden lines would be due to an unknown element, called coronium.

These structures are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that connect magnetic regions on the solar surface. The loops are sometimes as high as 10,000 km with their two ends situated in photosphere regions of opposite magnetic polarity. This implies that the coronal loops are tubes of magnetic flux filled with hot plasma. They last for days or weeks but most change quite rapidly.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1485Related#stellar-coronal-loopssolar-coronal-mass-ejection-shocks (Preliminary)Solar coronal mass ejection shockssolar-particle-emission, shocksSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1997solar-coronal-mass-ejections (Preliminary)Solar coronal mass ejectionsA huge eruption of material from regions of the solar corona in which the magnetic field is closed, but which suffer an extremely energetic disruption. Over the course of several hours up to 10,000 billion kg of this material is ejected into interplanetary space with a speed of as high as 3000 km/s. CMEs are most spectacularly observed by a white light coronagraph located outside Earth's atmosphere. Such observations from Skylab in the early 1970's were the first to reveal this phenomenon. CME's disrupt the flow of the solar wind and can produce intense electromagnetic disturbances that can severely damage satellites and disrupt power grids on Earth. When these ejections reach the Earth, they give rise to geomagnetic storms. The frequency varies with the solar cycle; during solar minimum they come at a rate of about one per week, and during maximum there is an average of about two or three per day.solar-stormSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/310Related#stellar-mass-loss#stellar-coronal-mass-ejections#ejectasolar-coronal-plumes (Preliminary)Solar coronal plumesA coronal feature of the Sun, which appears as long, thin streamers that project outward from the Sun's north and south poles.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2039Related#stellar-coronal-plumessolar-coronal-radio-emission (Preliminary)Solar coronal radio emissionsolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1993solar-coronal-seismology (Preliminary)Solar coronal seismologysolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1994solar-coronal-streamers (Preliminary)Solar coronal streamersA bright, narrow stream of particles traveling through the Sun's corona, visible in images taken with a coronagraph or during a total solar eclipse.

The dust particles are at most several microns in size and make up a disk stretching over almost 1 solar radius (700,000 km) from the Sun's surface. Unlike electrons, which are responsible for the K corona, the dust particles move relatively slowly.

The solar magnetic field is responsible for all solar magnetic phenomena, such as sunspots, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and the solar wind. The solar magnetic fields are observed from the Zeeman broadening of spectral lines, polarization effects on radio emission, and from the channeling of charged particles into visible coronal streamers. The strength of Sun's average magnetic field is 1 gauss (twice the average field on the surface of Earth, around 0.5 gauss), and can be as strong as 4,000 Gauss in the neighborhood of a large sunspot.solar-physics, helioseismologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1503Related#stellar-magnetic-fieldsNarrowersolar-dynamosolar-magnetic-flux-emergencesolar-magnetic-bright-pointssolar-magnetic-reconnectionsolar-magnetic-flux-emergence (Preliminary)Solar magnetic flux emergencesolar-magnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2000solar-magnetic-reconnection (Preliminary)Solar magnetic reconnectionsolar-magnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1504solar-mass (Preliminary)Solar massThe amount of mass in our Sun, about 330,000 times the Earth's mass.

The presence of these emission features, which are not seen in the spectra of normal galaxies, indicates a very high degree of ionization. Moreover, the nucleus radiates non-thermal continuum emission extending over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. It is thought that a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy accretes gas (accretion) from its surrounding environment to power Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies are divided into two types according to the width of their spectral lines. Type 1 Seyfert (Sy 1) galaxies have very broad emission lines (10^3 - 10^4 km s^-1), while Type 2 Seyferts (Sy 2) show relatively narrow lines (several hundred km s^-1). These spectral differences may be the result of viewing the nucleus from different angles. A Type 2 Seyfert galaxy may be a mostly edge-on view of matter spiraling in toward the supermassive black hole, whereas a Type 1 Seyfert provides a more pole-on view, allowing us to see the more turbulent region around the black hole.high-energy-astrophysics, emission-line-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1447shadow-bands (Preliminary)Shadow bandsFaint wavy lines of alternating light and dark that sometimes can be seen on flat, light-colored surfaces just before and just after a total solar eclipse.

As the fuel is progressively exhausted, the shell moves outward until it enters regions too cool for the reactions to continue. For example, after the exhaustion of hydrogen in the core, helium burning might take place in the core with a shell of hydrogen burning surrounding it.

Examples include Saturn's Prometheus and Pandora, which shepherd the narrow outer F ring and the Uranus satellites Cordelia and Ophelia and the epsilon ring. The faster-moving inside satellite accelerates the inner ring particles as it passes them, causing them to spiral out to larger orbits. At the same time the slower-moving outer satellite decelerates the outer ring particles as they pass by, causing them to spiral inward.

The loops are sometimes as high as 10,000 km with their two ends situated in photosphere regions of opposite magnetic polarity. This implies that the coronal loops are tubes of magnetic flux filled with hot plasma. They last for days or weeks but most change quite rapidly.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1485Related#stellar-coronal-loopssolar-coronal-mass-ejection-shocks (Preliminary)Solar coronal mass ejection shockssolar-particle-emission, shocksSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1997solar-coronal-mass-ejections (Preliminary)Solar coronal mass ejectionsA huge eruption of material from regions of the solar corona in which the magnetic field is closed, but which suffer an extremely energetic disruption. Over the course of several hours up to 10,000 billion kg of this material is ejected into interplanetary space with a speed of as high as 3000 km/s. CMEs are most spectacularly observed by a white light coronagraph located outside Earth's atmosphere. Such observations from Skylab in the early 1970's were the first to reveal this phenomenon. CME's disrupt the flow of the solar wind and can produce intense electromagnetic disturbances that can severely damage satellites and disrupt power grids on Earth. When these ejections reach the Earth, they give rise to geomagnetic storms. The frequency varies with the solar cycle; during solar minimum they come at a rate of about one per week, and during maximum there is an average of about two or three per day.solar-stormSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/310Related#stellar-mass-loss#stellar-coronal-mass-ejections#ejectasolar-coronal-plumes (Preliminary)Solar coronal plumesA coronal feature of the Sun, which appears as long, thin streamers that project outward from the Sun's north and south poles.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2039Related#stellar-coronal-plumessolar-coronal-radio-emission (Preliminary)Solar coronal radio emissionsolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1993solar-coronal-seismology (Preliminary)Solar coronal seismologysolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1994solar-coronal-streamers (Preliminary)Solar coronal streamersA bright, narrow stream of particles traveling through the Sun's corona, visible in images taken with a coronagraph or during a total solar eclipse.

The solar magnetic fields are observed from the Zeeman broadening of spectral lines, polarization effects on radio emission, and from the channeling of charged particles into visible coronal streamers. The strength of Sun's average magnetic field is 1 gauss (twice the average field on the surface of Earth, around 0.5 gauss), and can be as strong as 4,000 Gauss in the neighborhood of a large sunspot.solar-physics, helioseismologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1503Related#stellar-magnetic-fieldsNarrowersolar-dynamosolar-magnetic-flux-emergencesolar-magnetic-bright-pointssolar-magnetic-reconnectionsolar-magnetic-flux-emergence (Preliminary)Solar magnetic flux emergencesolar-magnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2000solar-magnetic-reconnection (Preliminary)Solar magnetic reconnectionsolar-magnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1504solar-mass (Preliminary)Solar massThe amount of mass in our Sun, about 330,000 times the Earth's mass.

The fragments of the incoming nucleus also interact again, also producing new particles.cosmic-raysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1438secular-parallax (Preliminary)Secular parallaxThe angle subtended at a star by a baseline that is the distance the Sun moves in a given interval of time with respect to the local standard of rest (4.09 AU per year).parallaxSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1439selenology (Preliminary)Selenologylunar-scienceSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1441Narrowerlunar-interiorlunar-magnetic-fieldslunar-gravitational-fieldlunar-geodesylunar-surfacelunar-featuressemi-barium-stars (Preliminary)Semi-barium starsbarium-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1442semi-detached-binary-stars (Preliminary)Semi-detached binary starsA binary system whose secondary member fills its Roche lobe but whose primary member does not.interacting-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1443Narrowercataclysmic-variable-starsx-ray-binary-starsalgol-variable-starssemi-regular-variable-stars (Preliminary)Semi-regular variable starsA type of giant or supergiant pulsating variable star, with intermediate or late spectra, showing noticeable periodicity in its light changes, accompanied or sometimes interrupted by various irregularities. Periods lie in the range from 20 to more than 2000 days, while the shapes of the light curve may be rather different and variable with each cycle. The amplitudes may be from several hundredths to several magnitudes (usually 1-2 magnitudes in the V filter). Examples are Betelgeuse, Antares, and Rasalgethi.

The presence of these emission features, which are not seen in the spectra of normal galaxies, indicates a very high degree of ionization. Moreover, the nucleus radiates non-thermal continuum emission extending over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. It is thought that a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy accretes gas (accretion) from its surrounding environment to power Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies are divided into two types according to the width of their spectral lines. Type 1 Seyfert (Sy 1) galaxies have very broad emission lines (10^3 - 10^4 km s^-1), while Type 2 Seyferts (Sy 2) show relatively narrow lines (several hundred km s^-1). These spectral differences may be the result of viewing the nucleus from different angles. A Type 2 Seyfert galaxy may be a mostly edge-on view of matter spiraling in toward the supermassive black hole, whereas a Type 1 Seyfert provides a more pole-on view, allowing us to see the more turbulent region around the black hole.high-energy-astrophysics, emission-line-galaxiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1447shadow-bands (Preliminary)Shadow bandsFaint wavy lines of alternating light and dark that sometimes can be seen on flat, light-colored surfaces just before and just after a total solar eclipse.

As the fuel is progressively exhausted, the shell moves outward until it enters regions too cool for the reactions to continue. For example, after the exhaustion of hydrogen in the core, helium burning might take place in the core with a shell of hydrogen burning surrounding it. Stars may have more than one region of shell burning during their stellar evolution, each shell with its own nuclear reactions.circumstellar-shellsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1450shell-stars (Preliminary)Shell starsA main-sequence star, usually of spectral class B to F, whose spectrum shows bright emission lines superimposed on the normal absorption lines.

Examples include Saturn's Prometheus and Pandora, which shepherd the narrow outer F ring and the Uranus satellites Cordelia and Ophelia and the epsilon ring. The faster-moving inside satellite accelerates the inner ring particles as it passes them, causing them to spiral out to larger orbits. At the same time the slower-moving outer satellite decelerates the outer ring particles as they pass by, causing them to spiral inward.

The gas density in these areas are very low, about 100 times less than that of coronal active regions. The magnetic field lines in a coronal hole extend out into interplanetary space rather than returning to the Sun's surface, as they do in other parts of the Sun (open magnetic field line). Ionized hot gas can escape easily along such a path, and this brings about high speed solar wind streams.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1484Related#stellar-coronal-holessolar-coronal-lines (Preliminary)Solar coronal linesAn emission line in the spectrum of the solar corona caused by highly ionized metal ions; especially those of iron, such as the red and green lines at 6375 Å and 5303 Å [Fe X] and [Fe XIV], respectively. From their discovery in 1870 until 1939, it was believed that these forbidden lines would be due to an unknown element, called coronium.

These structures are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that connect magnetic regions on the solar surface. The loops are sometimes as high as 10,000 km with their two ends situated in photosphere regions of opposite magnetic polarity. This implies that the coronal loops are tubes of magnetic flux filled with hot plasma. They last for days or weeks but most change quite rapidly.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1485Related#stellar-coronal-loopssolar-coronal-mass-ejection-shocks (Preliminary)Solar coronal mass ejection shockssolar-particle-emission, shocksSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1997solar-coronal-mass-ejections (Preliminary)Solar coronal mass ejectionsA huge eruption of material from regions of the solar corona in which the magnetic field is closed, but which suffer an extremely energetic disruption. Over the course of several hours up to 10,000 billion kg of this material is ejected into interplanetary space with a speed of as high as 3000 km/s. CMEs are most spectacularly observed by a white light coronagraph located outside Earth's atmosphere. Such observations from Skylab in the early 1970's were the first to reveal this phenomenon. CME's disrupt the flow of the solar wind and can produce intense electromagnetic disturbances that can severely damage satellites and disrupt power grids on Earth. When these ejections reach the Earth, they give rise to geomagnetic storms. The frequency varies with the solar cycle; during solar minimum they come at a rate of about one per week, and during maximum there is an average of about two or three per day.solar-stormSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/310Related#stellar-mass-loss#stellar-coronal-mass-ejections#ejectasolar-coronal-plumes (Preliminary)Solar coronal plumesA coronal feature of the Sun, which appears as long, thin streamers that project outward from the Sun's north and south poles.solar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2039Related#stellar-coronal-plumessolar-coronal-radio-emission (Preliminary)Solar coronal radio emissionsolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1993solar-coronal-seismology (Preliminary)Solar coronal seismologysolar-coronaSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1994solar-coronal-streamers (Preliminary)Solar coronal streamersA bright, narrow stream of particles traveling through the Sun's corona, visible in images taken with a coronagraph or during a total solar eclipse.

The dust particles are at most several microns in size and make up a disk stretching over almost 1 solar radius (700,000 km) from the Sun's surface. Unlike electrons, which are responsible for the K corona, the dust particles move relatively slowly.

Understanding how the solar magnetic field comes about is the fundamental problem of Solar Physics. The solar magnetic field is responsible for all solar magnetic phenomena, such as sunspots, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and the solar wind. The solar magnetic fields are observed from the Zeeman broadening of spectral lines, polarization effects on radio emission, and from the channeling of charged particles into visible coronal streamers. The strength of Sun's average magnetic field is 1 gauss (twice the average field on the surface of Earth, around 0.5 gauss), and can be as strong as 4,000 Gauss in the neighborhood of a large sunspot.solar-physics, helioseismologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1503Related#stellar-magnetic-fieldsNarrowersolar-dynamosolar-magnetic-flux-emergencesolar-magnetic-bright-pointssolar-magnetic-reconnectionsolar-magnetic-flux-emergence (Preliminary)Solar magnetic flux emergencesolar-magnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2000solar-magnetic-reconnection (Preliminary)Solar magnetic reconnectionsolar-magnetic-fieldsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1504solar-mass (Preliminary)Solar massThe amount of mass in our Sun, about 330,000 times the Earth's mass.

Sunspots appear dark because they are cooler (of about 4000 °C) than the surrounding photosphere (about 6000 °C). They range in size from a few hundred kilometers to several times the Earth's diameter and last from a few hours to a few months. Very small sunspots are called pores. The number of sunspots varies from maximum to minimum in about 11 years, the sunspot cycle. Their appearance during a cycle follows the Sporer law. A typical spot has a central umbra surrounded by a penumbra, although either features can exist without the other. Sunspots are associated with strong magnetic fields of 0.2 to 0.4 tesla. A given sunspot has a single magnetic polarity. The opposite polarity may be found in other sunspots or in the bright and diffuse facular region adjacent to the sunspot. The first recorded naked-eye sightings of sunspots were by Chinese astronomers in the first century B.C.

In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact object. In white dwarfs forming binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf. Consequently, the white dwarf collapses in a supernova explosion to form a neutron star. There are several supernova types.stellar-types, stellar-remnantsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1668Related#ejecta#burst-astrophysics#supernova-dynamics#white-dwarf-starsNarrowertype-ia-supernovaehypernovaecore-collapse-supernovaesupport-vector-machine (Preliminary)Support vector machineclassificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1936surface-composition (Preliminary)Surface compositionplanetary-surfacesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2115surface-gravity (Preliminary)Surface gravityThe rate at which a small object in free fall near the surface of a body is accelerated by the gravitational force of the body: g = GM / R^2, where G is the gravitational constant, and M and R are the mass and radius of the object.

The presence of these bands, broad H_{2}O features, and H_2 collision-induced absorption radically alter the spectral energy distributions of T dwarfs compared to a black body at the same temperature. Hence near-infrared colors become increasingly blue (J - K ~ 0) as compared to L dwarfs. The first T dwarf, called Gl 229B, was discovered by Nakajima et al.

Mean density 3.34 g cm-3. Mean distance from Earth 384,400 km. Escape velocity 2.38 km s-1. Surface gravity 162.2 cm s-2 = 0.165 Earth's. Sidereal period 27d 7h 43m 11s. Eccentricity 0.0549. Inclination of orbital plane to ecliptic 5° 8' 43''. Obliquity 6° 41'. Synodic period 29d 12h 44m 2s.9. Orbital velocity 1.02 km s-1. The Moon's average visual albedo is 0.12, a factor of three smaller than that of Earth. The Moon's center of mass is displaced about 2 km in the direction of Earth. The average temperature on the surface of the Moon during the day is 107 °C. During the night, the average temperature drops to -153 °C. Studies of lunar rock have shown that melting and separation must have begun at least 4.5 x 109 years ago, so the crust of the Moon was beginning to form a very short time after the solar system itself. Thickness of crust ~ 60 km; of mantle ~ 1000 km. Temperature of core ~ 1500 K. It would have taken only 107 years to slow the Moon's rotation into its present lock with its orbital period. Because of this synchronous rotation, the Moon revolves once on its axis each time it orbits the Earth, thus always presenting the same face, the nearside, toward Earth.

The Earth's rotation is faster than the Moon's orbital motion; therefore the Earth's tidal bulges lead the Moon on its orbit. This has two important effects: The Earth is being pulled slightly 'back' from its sense of rotation. So the Earth's rotation slows (by about 1 second every 50,000 years). Moreover, the Moon is being pulled slightly 'forward' on its orbit. So it is harder for the Earth to hold it in place, and it moves further away from the Earth (by about 3-4 cm per yr). Tidal friction tends to synchronize the rotation period of a close-in companion with the period of its orbital motion around the primary.tidal-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1698tidal-interaction (Preliminary)Tidal interactiongravitational-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1699Narrowertidestidal-frictionroche-limittidal-distortiontidal-disruptiontidal-radiustidal-radius (Preliminary)Tidal radiustidal-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1700tidal-tails (Preliminary)Tidal tailsA long stream of stars and gas, often in the form of a spectacular tail, thrown off a galaxy when it collides with another galaxy.

Called also Saturn VI. Titan has a diameter of 5,150 km, about half the size of Earth and almost as large as Mars. It orbits Saturn at a mean distance of 1,221,830 km every 15.945 days. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere. Its surface temperature is -179 °C, which makes water as hard as rocks and allows methane to be found in its liquid form. Its surface pressure is slightly higher than Earth's pressure (1.6 bars against 1 bar at sea level). The Huygens probe released from Cassini-Huygens landed on Titan on December 25, 2004. From the data obtained by Cassini-Huygens, we know that Titan is a world with lakes and seas composed of liquid methane and ethane near its poles, with vast, arid regions not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid water ice coated with hydrocarbons that fall from the atmosphere. Titan's icy dunes are gigantic, reaching, on average, 1 to 2 km wide, hundreds kilometers long and around 100 m high. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids flowing across its surface as the planet cycles through its seasons. Each Titan season lasts about 7.5 Earth years. The Huygens probe made the first direct measurements of Titan's lower atmosphere. Huygens also directly sampled aerosols in the atmosphere and confirmed that carbon and nitrogen are their major constituents. Cassini followed up Huygens' measurements from orbit, detecting other chemicals that include propylene and poisonous hydrogen cyanide, in Titan's atmosphere. Cassini's gravity measurements of Titan revealed that this moon is hiding an internal, liquid water and ammonia ocean beneath its surface. Huygens also measured radio signals during its descent that strongly suggested the presence of an ocean 55 to 80 km below the moon's surface.saturnian-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2186topocentric-microlensing-parallax (Preliminary)Topocentric microlensing parallaxmicrolensing-parallaxSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2150total-eclipses (Preliminary)Total eclipsesAn eclipse in which the whole of the disk of the Sun or Moon is obscured.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1704trans-neptunian-objects (Preliminary)Trans-Neptunian objectssmall-solar-system-bodies, kuiper-beltSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1705Narrowerneptune-trojansclassical-kuiper-belt-objectsplutoidsresonant-kuiper-belt-objectsdetached-objectstrans-planckian-physics (Preliminary)Trans-Planckian physicsblack-hole-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1706transient-detection (Preliminary)Transient detectiontime-series-analysisSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1957transient-sources (Preliminary)Transient sourceshigh-energy-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1851Related#time-domain-astronomyNarrowergamma-ray-transient-sourcesradio-transient-sourcesx-ray-transient-sourcesultraviolet-transient-sourcestransit-duration-variation-method (Preliminary)Transit duration variation methodtiming-variation-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1707transit-instruments (Preliminary)Transit instrumentsAn instrument mounted so as to allow it to be pointed only at objects in the sky crossing the local meridian.

When the white dwarf mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the degenerate electron pressure can no longer support the accumulated mass and the star collapses in a thermonuclear explosion producing a supernova. The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion.

With masses of M > 2 x 10^6 M_sun and radii > 10 parsecs (pc), UCDs are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. Nevertheless, the nature and origin of these objects is still widely debated. Early interpretations suggested that UCDs could be the most massive GCs or possibly the tidally stripped remnants of dwarf galaxies. However, there is evidence that both formation mechanisms could contribute to the UCD population. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been confirmed in most UCDs with masses M > 10^7 M_sun.

Quasars can also have such high or even higher bolometric luminosities. However LIRGs and ULIRGs emit the bulk of their energy in the infrared. Most of ULIRGs are found in merging and interacting galaxy systems.

In general, there is about one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host ULXs. The Milky Way contains no such objects. ULXs are thought to be powered by accretion onto a compact object. Possible explanations include accretion onto neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, onto stellar black holes (of up to 20 solar masses) at or in excess of the classical Eddington limit, or onto intermediate-mass black holes (10^3 - 10^5 solar masses).

It has a diameter about 51,100 km, four times that of the Earth, and a mass 14.5 times Earth's mass. Uranus orbits the Sun at a distance over 19 times the Earth-Sun distance. Although it takes about 84 years for Uranus to make a revolution, it completes a fast rotation in only 17 and a half hours. Unlike the other planets, its axis of rotation lies mostly in the plane of the Solar System. Uranus is internally less active than the other giant planets, which added to its larger distance from the Sun, makes it colder. It has a dense atmosphere made of mostly molecular hydrogen (83 percent) and helium (15 percent), with two percent methane and traces of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The planet's greenish-blue color is due to light scattering as in Earth's sky and the absorption of red light by its small amount of atmospheric methane.

Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth's diameter, 80% of Earth's mass). Its chemical composition and density are comparable to those of the Earth. It takes Venus just under 224.401 days to orbit the Sun, compared to the 365 day orbital period of the Earth. Venus' rotation is retrograde, that is it actually rotates from east to west, as opposed to west to east (prograde) which is the common rotating direction of most other planets. Seen from Venus, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. Moreover, it takes about 244 Earth days for Venus to rotate once (sidereal rotation). This is longer than its orbital period. The length of its solar day is about 117 Earth days. Venus rotation. Its axial tilt is only three degrees, so there are no seasons on Venus.

Sunspots appear dark because they are cooler (of about 4000 °C) than the surrounding photosphere (about 6000 °C). They range in size from a few hundred kilometers to several times the Earth's diameter and last from a few hours to a few months. Very small sunspots are called pores. The number of sunspots varies from maximum to minimum in about 11 years, the sunspot cycle. Their appearance during a cycle follows the Sporer law. A typical spot has a central umbra surrounded by a penumbra, although either features can exist without the other. Sunspots are associated with strong magnetic fields of 0.2 to 0.4 tesla. A given sunspot has a single magnetic polarity. The opposite polarity may be found in other sunspots or in the bright and diffuse facular region adjacent to the sunspot. The first recorded naked-eye sightings of sunspots were by Chinese astronomers in the first century B.C.

At maximum light, the supernova can have luminosity about 108 or 109 times the solar luminosity. The phenomenon results from the later evolution of stars when an instability sets in the core following the nucleosynthesis of iron. In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact object. In white dwarfs forming binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf. Consequently, the white dwarf collapses in a supernova explosion to form a neutron star.

The Earth's rotation is faster than the Moon's orbital motion; therefore the Earth's tidal bulges lead the Moon on its orbit. This has two important effects: The Earth is being pulled slightly 'back' from its sense of rotation. So the Earth's rotation slows (by about 1 second every 50,000 years). Moreover, the Moon is being pulled slightly 'forward' on its orbit. So it is harder for the Earth to hold it in place, and it moves further away from the Earth (by about 3-4 cm per yr). Tidal friction tends to synchronize the rotation period of a close-in companion with the period of its orbital motion around the primary.tidal-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1698tidal-interaction (Preliminary)Tidal interactiongravitational-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1699Narrowertidestidal-frictionroche-limittidal-distortiontidal-disruptiontidal-radiustidal-radius (Preliminary)Tidal radiustidal-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1700tidal-tails (Preliminary)Tidal tailsA long stream of stars and gas, often in the form of a spectacular tail, thrown off a galaxy when it collides with another galaxy.

Called also Saturn VI. Titan has a diameter of 5,150 km, about half the size of Earth and almost as large as Mars. It orbits Saturn at a mean distance of 1,221,830 km every 15.945 days. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere. Its surface temperature is -179 °C, which makes water as hard as rocks and allows methane to be found in its liquid form. Its surface pressure is slightly higher than Earth's pressure (1.6 bars against 1 bar at sea level). The Huygens probe released from Cassini-Huygens landed on Titan on December 25, 2004. From the data obtained by Cassini-Huygens, we know that Titan is a world with lakes and seas composed of liquid methane and ethane near its poles, with vast, arid regions not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid water ice coated with hydrocarbons that fall from the atmosphere. Titan's icy dunes are gigantic, reaching, on average, 1 to 2 km wide, hundreds kilometers long and around 100 m high. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids flowing across its surface as the planet cycles through its seasons. Each Titan season lasts about 7.5 Earth years. The Huygens probe made the first direct measurements of Titan's lower atmosphere. Huygens also directly sampled aerosols in the atmosphere and confirmed that carbon and nitrogen are their major constituents. Cassini followed up Huygens' measurements from orbit, detecting other chemicals that include propylene and poisonous hydrogen cyanide, in Titan's atmosphere. Cassini's gravity measurements of Titan revealed that this moon is hiding an internal, liquid water and ammonia ocean beneath its surface. Huygens also measured radio signals during its descent that strongly suggested the presence of an ocean 55 to 80 km below the moon's surface.saturnian-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2186topocentric-microlensing-parallax (Preliminary)Topocentric microlensing parallaxmicrolensing-parallaxSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2150total-eclipses (Preliminary)Total eclipsesAn eclipse in which the whole of the disk of the Sun or Moon is obscured.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1704trans-neptunian-objects (Preliminary)Trans-Neptunian objectssmall-solar-system-bodies, kuiper-beltSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1705Narrowerneptune-trojansclassical-kuiper-belt-objectsplutoidsresonant-kuiper-belt-objectsdetached-objectstrans-planckian-physics (Preliminary)Trans-Planckian physicsblack-hole-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1706transient-detection (Preliminary)Transient detectiontime-series-analysisSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1957transient-sources (Preliminary)Transient sourceshigh-energy-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1851Related#time-domain-astronomyNarrowergamma-ray-transient-sourcesradio-transient-sourcesx-ray-transient-sourcesultraviolet-transient-sourcestransit-duration-variation-method (Preliminary)Transit duration variation methodtiming-variation-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1707transit-instruments (Preliminary)Transit instrumentsAn instrument mounted so as to allow it to be pointed only at objects in the sky crossing the local meridian.

Type Ia SNe are believed to result from mass accretion to a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a close binary system. When the white dwarf mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the degenerate electron pressure can no longer support the accumulated mass and the star collapses in a thermonuclear explosion producing a supernova. The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion.

With masses of M > 2 x 10^6 M_sun and radii > 10 parsecs (pc), UCDs are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. Nevertheless, the nature and origin of these objects is still widely debated. Early interpretations suggested that UCDs could be the most massive GCs or possibly the tidally stripped remnants of dwarf galaxies. However, there is evidence that both formation mechanisms could contribute to the UCD population. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been confirmed in most UCDs with masses M > 10^7 M_sun.

Quasars can also have such high or even higher bolometric luminosities. However LIRGs and ULIRGs emit the bulk of their energy in the infrared. Most of ULIRGs are found in merging and interacting galaxy systems.

In general, there is about one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host ULXs. The Milky Way contains no such objects. ULXs are thought to be powered by accretion onto a compact object. Possible explanations include accretion onto neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, onto stellar black holes (of up to 20 solar masses) at or in excess of the classical Eddington limit, or onto intermediate-mass black holes (10^3 - 10^5 solar masses).

Although it takes about 84 years for Uranus to make a revolution, it completes a fast rotation in only 17 and a half hours. Unlike the other planets, its axis of rotation lies mostly in the plane of the Solar System. Uranus is internally less active than the other giant planets, which added to its larger distance from the Sun, makes it colder. It has a dense atmosphere made of mostly molecular hydrogen (83 percent) and helium (15 percent), with two percent methane and traces of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The planet's greenish-blue color is due to light scattering as in Earth's sky and the absorption of red light by its small amount of atmospheric methane.

Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth's diameter, 80% of Earth's mass). Its chemical composition and density are comparable to those of the Earth. It takes Venus just under 224.401 days to orbit the Sun, compared to the 365 day orbital period of the Earth. Venus' rotation is retrograde, that is it actually rotates from east to west, as opposed to west to east (prograde) which is the common rotating direction of most other planets. Seen from Venus, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. Moreover, it takes about 244 Earth days for Venus to rotate once (sidereal rotation). This is longer than its orbital period. The length of its solar day is about 117 Earth days. Venus rotation. Its axial tilt is only three degrees, so there are no seasons on Venus.

For a rotating star in which centrifugal forces are not negligible, the equipotentials where gravity, centrifugal force, and pressure are balanced will no longer be spheres. The theorem states that the radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity at the considered colatitude, F(θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)α, where α is the gravity darkening coefficient. As a consequence, the stellar surface will not be uniformly bright, because there is a much larger flux and a higher effective temperature at the pole than at the equator (T_eff (θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)β, where β is the gravity darkening exponent. In massive stars this latitudinal dependence of the temperature leads to asymmetric mass loss and also to enhanced average mass loss rates.analytical-mathematicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1781Related#stellar-rotationvoronoi-tessellation (Preliminary)Voronoi tessellationspatial-point-processesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1952vy-sculpturis-stars (Preliminary)VY Sculpturis starsnova-like-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1782w-ursae-majoris-variable-stars (Preliminary)W Ursae Majoris variable starseclipsing-binary-stars, contact-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1783w-virginis-variable-stars (Preliminary)W Virginis variable starsA member of a class of pulsating stars with a period of 1 to 35 days located in the instability strip of the H-R diagram.

In addition, during its whole life the photometer was mounted permanently on the same telescope that had been built specifically for this instrument, the 91 cm 'Lightcollector' reflector, which started in 1958 at the Leiden Southern Station in Broederstroom, South-Africa. After 20 years in South-Africa the telescope and photometer were moved to the European Southern Observatory La Silla observatory in Chile.

H_{2}O masers are detected toward star formation regions and the envelopes of evolved stars. The maser emission comes from regions that are typically quite small, not larger than the solar system. The main emission frequency is 22 GHz, which shows up in strong lines. There are, however, other H_{2}O maser transitions at 380 GHz and 183 GHz, which are much weaker than the 22 GHz line. The former transitions are sporadically detected since they are strongly absorbed in the Earth's atmosphere, because of its high water vapor content.astrophysical-masersSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1790water-vapor (Preliminary)Water vaporWater in the gaseous state.

In 1984, his collaboration with Alex Grossmann yielded a detailed mathematical study of the continuous wavelet transforms and their various applications.

A white dwarf is what remains after the central star of a planetary nebula fades and becomes cool. The Chandrasekhar limit of 1.43 solar masses is the highest mass that a white dwarf can achieve before electron degeneracy pressure is unable to support it. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, white dwarfs form a well-defined sequence around 8 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence. They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B, the companion of Sirius. White dwarfs are divided into several types, according to their spectral features, which depend on the type of shell burning that dominated as it became a planetary nebula: DA white dwarf; DB white dwarf; DC white dwarf; DO white dwarf; DZ white dwarf; DQ white dwarf.stellar-evolutionary-types, compact-objectsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1799Related#chandrasekhar-limit#supernovae#type-ia-supernovaeNarrowerdz-starsdb-starsdq-starsdc-starsdo-starszz-ceti-starsda-starswide-binary-stars (Preliminary)Wide binary starsA binary system with semi-major axis as large as 10,000 astronomical units.binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1801wide-field-telescopes (Preliminary)Wide-field telescopestelescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1800Narrowerall-sky-camerasbaker-nunn-cameraswilson-effect (Preliminary)Wilson effectA phenomenon in which the shape of sunspots flattens as they approach the Sun's limb due to the solar rotation.

The research field includes: X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, pulsars, black holes, dark matter, active galaxies, galactic clusters X-ray transients. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays coming from outer space. X-ray astronomy therefore requires observations to be done above atmosphere. The first rocket flight which successfully detected a cosmic source of X-ray emission was launched in 1962 by an American research group. A very bright source was detected that they named Scorpius X-1. Since then several dedicated X-ray astronomy satellites have been launched, among which: Uhuru, INTEGRAL, ROSAT, Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), Chandra X-ray Observatory, and XMM-Newton, which have contributed to important advances in astronomy.astronomical-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1810Related#x-ray-sourcesNarrowerx-ray-identificationx-ray-bright-pointx-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)X-ray binary starsA binary star system where one of the stars has evolved and collapsed into an extremely dense body such as a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole.

The three main phases are: 1) the free expansion phase, 2) the Sedov-Taylor phase, and 3) the snowplow phase.interstellar-medium, nebulaeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1667supernovae (Preliminary)SupernovaeA violent stellar explosion which blows off all or most of the star's material at high velocity leaving a compact stellar remnant such as a neutron star or black hole. At maximum light, the supernova can have luminosity about 108 or 109 times the solar luminosity. The phenomenon results from the later evolution of stars when an instability sets in the core following the nucleosynthesis of iron. In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact object. In white dwarfs forming binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf. Consequently, the white dwarf collapses in a supernova explosion to form a neutron star. There are several supernova types.stellar-types, stellar-remnantsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1668Related#ejecta#burst-astrophysics#supernova-dynamics#white-dwarf-starsNarrowertype-ia-supernovaehypernovaecore-collapse-supernovaesupport-vector-machine (Preliminary)Support vector machineclassificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1936surface-composition (Preliminary)Surface compositionplanetary-surfacesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2115surface-gravity (Preliminary)Surface gravityThe rate at which a small object in free fall near the surface of a body is accelerated by the gravitational force of the body: g = GM / R^2, where G is the gravitational constant, and M and R are the mass and radius of the object.

The presence of these bands, broad H_{2}O features, and H_2 collision-induced absorption radically alter the spectral energy distributions of T dwarfs compared to a black body at the same temperature. Hence near-infrared colors become increasingly blue (J - K ~ 0) as compared to L dwarfs. The first T dwarf, called Gl 229B, was discovered by Nakajima et al.

Mean density 3.34 g cm-3. Mean distance from Earth 384,400 km. Escape velocity 2.38 km s-1. Surface gravity 162.2 cm s-2 = 0.165 Earth's. Sidereal period 27d 7h 43m 11s. Eccentricity 0.0549. Inclination of orbital plane to ecliptic 5° 8' 43''. Obliquity 6° 41'. Synodic period 29d 12h 44m 2s.9. Orbital velocity 1.02 km s-1. The Moon's average visual albedo is 0.12, a factor of three smaller than that of Earth. The Moon's center of mass is displaced about 2 km in the direction of Earth. The average temperature on the surface of the Moon during the day is 107 °C. During the night, the average temperature drops to -153 °C. Studies of lunar rock have shown that melting and separation must have begun at least 4.5 x 109 years ago, so the crust of the Moon was beginning to form a very short time after the solar system itself. Thickness of crust ~ 60 km; of mantle ~ 1000 km. Temperature of core ~ 1500 K. It would have taken only 107 years to slow the Moon's rotation into its present lock with its orbital period. Because of this synchronous rotation, the Moon revolves once on its axis each time it orbits the Earth, thus always presenting the same face, the nearside, toward Earth. The Moon may have formed during a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized rocky planet about 4.6 billion years ago; Theia.natural-satellites-solar-system, solar-systemSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1692Related#earth-planet#lunar-sciencethe-sun (Preliminary)The SunThe star that governs the solar system.

The Earth's rotation is faster than the Moon's orbital motion; therefore the Earth's tidal bulges lead the Moon on its orbit. This has two important effects: The Earth is being pulled slightly 'back' from its sense of rotation. So the Earth's rotation slows (by about 1 second every 50,000 years). Moreover, the Moon is being pulled slightly 'forward' on its orbit. So it is harder for the Earth to hold it in place, and it moves further away from the Earth (by about 3-4 cm per yr). Tidal friction tends to synchronize the rotation period of a close-in companion with the period of its orbital motion around the primary.tidal-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1698tidal-interaction (Preliminary)Tidal interactiongravitational-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1699Narrowertidestidal-frictionroche-limittidal-distortiontidal-disruptiontidal-radiustidal-radius (Preliminary)Tidal radiustidal-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1700tidal-tails (Preliminary)Tidal tailsA long stream of stars and gas, often in the form of a spectacular tail, thrown off a galaxy when it collides with another galaxy.

Called also Saturn VI. Titan has a diameter of 5,150 km, about half the size of Earth and almost as large as Mars. It orbits Saturn at a mean distance of 1,221,830 km every 15.945 days. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere. Its surface temperature is -179 °C, which makes water as hard as rocks and allows methane to be found in its liquid form. Its surface pressure is slightly higher than Earth's pressure (1.6 bars against 1 bar at sea level). The Huygens probe released from Cassini-Huygens landed on Titan on December 25, 2004. From the data obtained by Cassini-Huygens, we know that Titan is a world with lakes and seas composed of liquid methane and ethane near its poles, with vast, arid regions not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid water ice coated with hydrocarbons that fall from the atmosphere. Titan's icy dunes are gigantic, reaching, on average, 1 to 2 km wide, hundreds kilometers long and around 100 m high. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids flowing across its surface as the planet cycles through its seasons. Each Titan season lasts about 7.5 Earth years. The Huygens probe made the first direct measurements of Titan's lower atmosphere. Huygens also directly sampled aerosols in the atmosphere and confirmed that carbon and nitrogen are their major constituents. Cassini followed up Huygens' measurements from orbit, detecting other chemicals that include propylene and poisonous hydrogen cyanide, in Titan's atmosphere. Cassini's gravity measurements of Titan revealed that this moon is hiding an internal, liquid water and ammonia ocean beneath its surface. Huygens also measured radio signals during its descent that strongly suggested the presence of an ocean 55 to 80 km below the moon's surface.saturnian-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2186topocentric-microlensing-parallax (Preliminary)Topocentric microlensing parallaxmicrolensing-parallaxSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2150total-eclipses (Preliminary)Total eclipsesAn eclipse in which the whole of the disk of the Sun or Moon is obscured.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1704trans-neptunian-objects (Preliminary)Trans-Neptunian objectssmall-solar-system-bodies, kuiper-beltSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1705Narrowerneptune-trojansclassical-kuiper-belt-objectsplutoidsresonant-kuiper-belt-objectsdetached-objectstrans-planckian-physics (Preliminary)Trans-Planckian physicsblack-hole-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1706transient-detection (Preliminary)Transient detectiontime-series-analysisSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1957transient-sources (Preliminary)Transient sourceshigh-energy-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1851Related#time-domain-astronomyNarrowergamma-ray-transient-sourcesradio-transient-sourcesx-ray-transient-sourcesultraviolet-transient-sourcestransit-duration-variation-method (Preliminary)Transit duration variation methodtiming-variation-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1707transit-instruments (Preliminary)Transit instrumentsAn instrument mounted so as to allow it to be pointed only at objects in the sky crossing the local meridian.

When the white dwarf mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the degenerate electron pressure can no longer support the accumulated mass and the star collapses in a thermonuclear explosion producing a supernova. The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion.

With masses of M > 2 x 10^6 M_sun and radii > 10 parsecs (pc), UCDs are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. Nevertheless, the nature and origin of these objects is still widely debated. Early interpretations suggested that UCDs could be the most massive GCs or possibly the tidally stripped remnants of dwarf galaxies. However, there is evidence that both formation mechanisms could contribute to the UCD population. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been confirmed in most UCDs with masses M > 10^7 M_sun.

Quasars can also have such high or even higher bolometric luminosities. However LIRGs and ULIRGs emit the bulk of their energy in the infrared. Most of ULIRGs are found in merging and interacting galaxy systems.

In general, there is about one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host ULXs. The Milky Way contains no such objects. ULXs are thought to be powered by accretion onto a compact object. Possible explanations include accretion onto neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, onto stellar black holes (of up to 20 solar masses) at or in excess of the classical Eddington limit, or onto intermediate-mass black holes (10^3 - 10^5 solar masses).

It has a diameter about 51,100 km, four times that of the Earth, and a mass 14.5 times Earth's mass. Uranus orbits the Sun at a distance over 19 times the Earth-Sun distance. Although it takes about 84 years for Uranus to make a revolution, it completes a fast rotation in only 17 and a half hours. Unlike the other planets, its axis of rotation lies mostly in the plane of the Solar System. Uranus is internally less active than the other giant planets, which added to its larger distance from the Sun, makes it colder. It has a dense atmosphere made of mostly molecular hydrogen (83 percent) and helium (15 percent), with two percent methane and traces of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The planet's greenish-blue color is due to light scattering as in Earth's sky and the absorption of red light by its small amount of atmospheric methane.

Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth's diameter, 80% of Earth's mass). Its chemical composition and density are comparable to those of the Earth. It takes Venus just under 224.401 days to orbit the Sun, compared to the 365 day orbital period of the Earth. Venus' rotation is retrograde, that is it actually rotates from east to west, as opposed to west to east (prograde) which is the common rotating direction of most other planets. Seen from Venus, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. Moreover, it takes about 244 Earth days for Venus to rotate once (sidereal rotation). This is longer than its orbital period. The length of its solar day is about 117 Earth days. Venus rotation. Its axial tilt is only three degrees, so there are no seasons on Venus.

For a rotating star in which centrifugal forces are not negligible, the equipotentials where gravity, centrifugal force, and pressure are balanced will no longer be spheres. The theorem states that the radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity at the considered colatitude, F(θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)α, where α is the gravity darkening coefficient. As a consequence, the stellar surface will not be uniformly bright, because there is a much larger flux and a higher effective temperature at the pole than at the equator (T_eff (θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)β, where β is the gravity darkening exponent.

In addition, during its whole life the photometer was mounted permanently on the same telescope that had been built specifically for this instrument, the 91 cm 'Lightcollector' reflector, which started in 1958 at the Leiden Southern Station in Broederstroom, South-Africa. After 20 years in South-Africa the telescope and photometer were moved to the European Southern Observatory La Silla observatory in Chile.

The main emission frequency is 22 GHz, which shows up in strong lines. There are, however, other H_{2}O maser transitions at 380 GHz and 183 GHz, which are much weaker than the 22 GHz line.

A white dwarf is what remains after the central star of a planetary nebula fades and becomes cool. The Chandrasekhar limit of 1.43 solar masses is the highest mass that a white dwarf can achieve before electron degeneracy pressure is unable to support it. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, white dwarfs form a well-defined sequence around 8 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence. They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B, the companion of Sirius. White dwarfs are divided into several types, according to their spectral features, which depend on the type of shell burning that dominated as it became a planetary nebula: DA white dwarf; DB white dwarf; DC white dwarf; DO white dwarf; DZ white dwarf; DQ white dwarf.stellar-evolutionary-types, compact-objectsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1799Related#chandrasekhar-limit#supernovae#type-ia-supernovaeNarrowerdz-starsdb-starsdq-starsdc-starsdo-starszz-ceti-starsda-starswide-binary-stars (Preliminary)Wide binary starsA binary system with semi-major axis as large as 10,000 astronomical units.binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1801wide-field-telescopes (Preliminary)Wide-field telescopestelescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1800Narrowerall-sky-camerasbaker-nunn-cameraswilson-effect (Preliminary)Wilson effectA phenomenon in which the shape of sunspots flattens as they approach the Sun's limb due to the solar rotation.

The research field includes: X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, pulsars, black holes, dark matter, active galaxies, galactic clusters X-ray transients. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays coming from outer space. X-ray astronomy therefore requires observations to be done above atmosphere.

The first celestial X-ray source, after the Sun, to be detected was Scorpius X-1 by means of rocket flight.astronomical-radiation-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1822Related#x-ray-binary-stars#x-ray-astronomy#solar-x-ray-flaresNarrowerx-ray-burstscool-coresultraluminous-x-ray-sourcesx-ray-transient-sourcesdiffuse-x-ray-backgroundx-ray-point-sourcesx-ray-stars (Preliminary)X-ray starsemission-line-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1823Narrowersingle-x-ray-starsx-ray-surveys (Preliminary)X-ray surveyssurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1824x-ray-telescopes (Preliminary)X-ray telescopesA telescope designed to focus X-rays from astronomical objects.

Recurrences can be periodic or aperiodic, but there is no obvious correlation between recurrence time and the luminosity amplitude of the outburst. X-ray transients seem to be divided into two classes: those associated with high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) stars and those associated with low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) stars. The HMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole paired with a massive star. Often, the stellar companion is a Be star, Be star, which sometimes sheds material from its equatorial region. In these systems, the transient event is characterized by having more higher energy X-rays in the spectrum. The LMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole orbiting around a cooler, low-mass star. These transient events often generate more lower-energy X-rays.transient-sources, x-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1852Related#x-ray-burstsNarrowerx-ray-burstersxallarap-effect (Preliminary)Xallarap effectbinary-source-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2139xenobiology (Preliminary)XenobiologyThe study of synthesizing and manipulating biological devices and systems.astrobiologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1826y-dwarfs (Preliminary)Y dwarfsA type of ultra-cool brown dwarf with an effective temperature lower than 500 K.

Sunspots appear dark because they are cooler (of about 4000 °C) than the surrounding photosphere (about 6000 °C). They range in size from a few hundred kilometers to several times the Earth's diameter and last from a few hours to a few months. Very small sunspots are called pores. The number of sunspots varies from maximum to minimum in about 11 years, the sunspot cycle. Their appearance during a cycle follows the Sporer law. A typical spot has a central umbra surrounded by a penumbra, although either features can exist without the other. Sunspots are associated with strong magnetic fields of 0.2 to 0.4 tesla. A given sunspot has a single magnetic polarity. The opposite polarity may be found in other sunspots or in the bright and diffuse facular region adjacent to the sunspot. The first recorded naked-eye sightings of sunspots were by Chinese astronomers in the first century B.C. Johannes Fabricius (1587-1617) was the first to argue that sunspots are areas on the solar surface.solar-physics, solar-active-regionsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1653Related#starspots#sunspot-cycleNarrowerdelta-sunspotsephemeral-active-regionswilson-effectsunspot-numbermaunder-minimumsunspot-groupssunspot-flowsunyaev-zeldovich-effect (Preliminary)Sunyaev-Zeldovich effectcosmic-microwave-background-radiation, radio-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1654super-earths (Preliminary)Super EarthsAn extrasolar planet more massive than the Earth but less massive than 10 Earth masses.

Supernova remnants are generally powerful radio sources. The evolution of the SNR can be divided into different phases according to the dominant physical processes. Simplified models are made for the first stages, to get an idea of typical time scales, expansion velocities, and sizes.

At maximum light, the supernova can have luminosity about 108 or 109 times the solar luminosity. The phenomenon results from the later evolution of stars when an instability sets in the core following the nucleosynthesis of iron. In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact object. In white dwarfs forming binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf. Consequently, the white dwarf collapses in a supernova explosion to form a neutron star. There are several supernova types.stellar-types, stellar-remnantsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1668Related#ejecta#burst-astrophysics#supernova-dynamics#white-dwarf-starsNarrowertype-ia-supernovaehypernovaecore-collapse-supernovaesupport-vector-machine (Preliminary)Support vector machineclassificationSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1936surface-composition (Preliminary)Surface compositionplanetary-surfacesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2115surface-gravity (Preliminary)Surface gravityThe rate at which a small object in free fall near the surface of a body is accelerated by the gravitational force of the body: g = GM / R^2, where G is the gravitational constant, and M and R are the mass and radius of the object.

The Moon's average visual albedo is 0.12, a factor of three smaller than that of Earth. The Moon's center of mass is displaced about 2 km in the direction of Earth. The average temperature on the surface of the Moon during the day is 107 °C. During the night, the average temperature drops to -153 °C. Studies of lunar rock have shown that melting and separation must have begun at least 4.5 x 109 years ago, so the crust of the Moon was beginning to form a very short time after the solar system itself. Thickness of crust ~ 60 km; of mantle ~ 1000 km. Temperature of core ~ 1500 K. It would have taken only 107 years to slow the Moon's rotation into its present lock with its orbital period. Because of this synchronous rotation, the Moon revolves once on its axis each time it orbits the Earth, thus always presenting the same face, the nearside, toward Earth.

The Earth's rotation is faster than the Moon's orbital motion; therefore the Earth's tidal bulges lead the Moon on its orbit. This has two important effects: The Earth is being pulled slightly 'back' from its sense of rotation. So the Earth's rotation slows (by about 1 second every 50,000 years). Moreover, the Moon is being pulled slightly 'forward' on its orbit. So it is harder for the Earth to hold it in place, and it moves further away from the Earth (by about 3-4 cm per yr). Tidal friction tends to synchronize the rotation period of a close-in companion with the period of its orbital motion around the primary.tidal-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1698tidal-interaction (Preliminary)Tidal interactiongravitational-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1699Narrowertidestidal-frictionroche-limittidal-distortiontidal-disruptiontidal-radiustidal-radius (Preliminary)Tidal radiustidal-interactionSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1700tidal-tails (Preliminary)Tidal tailsA long stream of stars and gas, often in the form of a spectacular tail, thrown off a galaxy when it collides with another galaxy.

Called also Saturn VI. Titan has a diameter of 5,150 km, about half the size of Earth and almost as large as Mars. It orbits Saturn at a mean distance of 1,221,830 km every 15.945 days. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere. Its surface temperature is -179 °C, which makes water as hard as rocks and allows methane to be found in its liquid form. Its surface pressure is slightly higher than Earth's pressure (1.6 bars against 1 bar at sea level). The Huygens probe released from Cassini-Huygens landed on Titan on December 25, 2004. From the data obtained by Cassini-Huygens, we know that Titan is a world with lakes and seas composed of liquid methane and ethane near its poles, with vast, arid regions not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid water ice coated with hydrocarbons that fall from the atmosphere. Titan's icy dunes are gigantic, reaching, on average, 1 to 2 km wide, hundreds kilometers long and around 100 m high. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids flowing across its surface as the planet cycles through its seasons. Each Titan season lasts about 7.5 Earth years. The Huygens probe made the first direct measurements of Titan's lower atmosphere. Huygens also directly sampled aerosols in the atmosphere and confirmed that carbon and nitrogen are their major constituents. Cassini followed up Huygens' measurements from orbit, detecting other chemicals that include propylene and poisonous hydrogen cyanide, in Titan's atmosphere. Cassini's gravity measurements of Titan revealed that this moon is hiding an internal, liquid water and ammonia ocean beneath its surface. Huygens also measured radio signals during its descent that strongly suggested the presence of an ocean 55 to 80 km below the moon's surface.saturnian-satellitesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2186topocentric-microlensing-parallax (Preliminary)Topocentric microlensing parallaxmicrolensing-parallaxSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2150total-eclipses (Preliminary)Total eclipsesAn eclipse in which the whole of the disk of the Sun or Moon is obscured.eclipsesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1704trans-neptunian-objects (Preliminary)Trans-Neptunian objectssmall-solar-system-bodies, kuiper-beltSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1705Narrowerneptune-trojansclassical-kuiper-belt-objectsplutoidsresonant-kuiper-belt-objectsdetached-objectstrans-planckian-physics (Preliminary)Trans-Planckian physicsblack-hole-physicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1706transient-detection (Preliminary)Transient detectiontime-series-analysisSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1957transient-sources (Preliminary)Transient sourceshigh-energy-astrophysicsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1851Related#time-domain-astronomyNarrowergamma-ray-transient-sourcesradio-transient-sourcesx-ray-transient-sourcesultraviolet-transient-sourcestransit-duration-variation-method (Preliminary)Transit duration variation methodtiming-variation-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1707transit-instruments (Preliminary)Transit instrumentsAn instrument mounted so as to allow it to be pointed only at objects in the sky crossing the local meridian.

Type Ia SNe are believed to result from mass accretion to a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a close binary system. When the white dwarf mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the degenerate electron pressure can no longer support the accumulated mass and the star collapses in a thermonuclear explosion producing a supernova. The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion.

With masses of M > 2 x 10^6 M_sun and radii > 10 parsecs (pc), UCDs are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. Nevertheless, the nature and origin of these objects is still widely debated. Early interpretations suggested that UCDs could be the most massive GCs or possibly the tidally stripped remnants of dwarf galaxies. However, there is evidence that both formation mechanisms could contribute to the UCD population. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been confirmed in most UCDs with masses M > 10^7 M_sun.

Possible explanations include accretion onto neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, onto stellar black holes (of up to 20 solar masses) at or in excess of the classical Eddington limit, or onto intermediate-mass black holes (10^3 - 10^5 solar masses).

Although it takes about 84 years for Uranus to make a revolution, it completes a fast rotation in only 17 and a half hours. Unlike the other planets, its axis of rotation lies mostly in the plane of the Solar System. Uranus is internally less active than the other giant planets, which added to its larger distance from the Sun, makes it colder. It has a dense atmosphere made of mostly molecular hydrogen (83 percent) and helium (15 percent), with two percent methane and traces of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The planet's greenish-blue color is due to light scattering as in Earth's sky and the absorption of red light by its small amount of atmospheric methane.

Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth's diameter, 80% of Earth's mass). Its chemical composition and density are comparable to those of the Earth. It takes Venus just under 224.401 days to orbit the Sun, compared to the 365 day orbital period of the Earth. Venus' rotation is retrograde, that is it actually rotates from east to west, as opposed to west to east (prograde) which is the common rotating direction of most other planets. Seen from Venus, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. Moreover, it takes about 244 Earth days for Venus to rotate once (sidereal rotation). This is longer than its orbital period. The length of its solar day is about 117 Earth days. Venus rotation. Its axial tilt is only three degrees, so there are no seasons on Venus.

For a rotating star in which centrifugal forces are not negligible, the equipotentials where gravity, centrifugal force, and pressure are balanced will no longer be spheres. The theorem states that the radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity at the considered colatitude, F(θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)α, where α is the gravity darkening coefficient. As a consequence, the stellar surface will not be uniformly bright, because there is a much larger flux and a higher effective temperature at the pole than at the equator (T_eff (θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)β, where β is the gravity darkening exponent.

Although similar results had already been obtained 20-50 years earlier by several other researchers, the rediscovery of the old concepts provided a new method for decomposing functions.astrostatistics-techniquesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1918wc-stars (Preliminary)WC starsA Wolf-Rayet star whose spectrum is dominated by emission lines of ionized carbon: C III 5696 Å, C III / C IV 4650 Å, C IV 5801-12 Å.

The distortion allows the distribution of dark matter and its evolution with time to be measured, thereby probing the influence of dark energy on the growth of structures. Weak gravitational lensing is generally difficult to identify in individual images, in contrast to strong gravitational lensing.gravitational-lensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1797weak-line-t-tauri-stars (Preliminary)Weak-line T Tauri starsA T Tauri star that lacks strong emission lines in its optical spectrum, and lacks both strong stellar wind and infrared excess. These objects are believed to be pre-main sequence stars without obvious signs for disk accretion. Weak-line T Tauri stars result from the evolution of classical T Tauri stars.t-tauri-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1795white-dwarf-stars (Preliminary)White dwarf starsA compact star of high surface temperature, low luminosity, and high density (10^5 - 10^8 g cm^-3), with roughly the mass of the Sun (mean mass ~ 0.6 M_sun) and the radius of the Earth (R ~ 0.01 R_sun), representing the end-point of the evolution of all stars with masses less then ~ 5-9 solar masses. A white dwarf is what remains after the central star of a planetary nebula fades and becomes cool. The Chandrasekhar limit of 1.43 solar masses is the highest mass that a white dwarf can achieve before electron degeneracy pressure is unable to support it. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, white dwarfs form a well-defined sequence around 8 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence. They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B, the companion of Sirius. White dwarfs are divided into several types, according to their spectral features, which depend on the type of shell burning that dominated as it became a planetary nebula: DA white dwarf; DB white dwarf; DC white dwarf; DO white dwarf; DZ white dwarf; DQ white dwarf.stellar-evolutionary-types, compact-objectsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1799Related#chandrasekhar-limit#supernovae#type-ia-supernovaeNarrowerdz-starsdb-starsdq-starsdc-starsdo-starszz-ceti-starsda-starswide-binary-stars (Preliminary)Wide binary starsA binary system with semi-major axis as large as 10,000 astronomical units.binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1801wide-field-telescopes (Preliminary)Wide-field telescopestelescopesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1800Narrowerall-sky-camerasbaker-nunn-cameraswilson-effect (Preliminary)Wilson effectA phenomenon in which the shape of sunspots flattens as they approach the Sun's limb due to the solar rotation. More specifically, when a sunspot approaches the solar limbs the width of the penumbra, relative to the umbra, on the side facing the center of the Sun seems to become narrower than on the side facing the limb. This phenomenon arises from a projection effect, and is due to a geometrical depression (the Wilson depression) in the layers of constant optical depth in sunspots.sunspotsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1803winter-solstice (Preliminary)Winter solsticeThe moment in the northern hemisphere when the Sun attains its lowest declination of -23°26' (or -23°.44) with respect the equator plane. It happens when the Earth's axis is orientated directly away from the Sun, on 21 or 22 December. During the northern winter solstice the Sun appears to be directly overhead at noon for places situated at latitude 23.44 degrees south, known as the tropic of Capricorn. The winter solstice can occur at any moment during the day. Two successive winter solstices are shifted in time by about 6 h. The winter solstice in the northern hemisphere is the summer solstice in the southern hemisphere.solsticeSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1804wn-stars (Preliminary)WN starsA Wolf-Rayet star whose spectrum is dominated by emission lines of ionized nitrogen: N II 3995 Å, N III 4634-4661 Å, N III 5314 Å, N IV 3479-3484 Å, N IV 4058 Å, N V 4603 Å, N V 4619 Å, and N V 4933-4944 Å.

The most massive O stars (M > 25 solar masses for solar metallicity) become W-R stars around 2 and 3 million years after their birth, spending only some few hundreds of thousands of years (≤ 10^6 years) in this phase until they explode as type Ib and type Ic supernovae. The minimum stellar mass that an O star needs to reach the W-R phase and its duration is dependent on metallicity.early-type-emission-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1806Related#stellar-classificationNarrowerwcn-starswn-starswc-starswormholes (Preliminary)WormholesA hypothetical topological feature, based on general relativity, that connects two different points like a 'tunnel' in space-time. The most common concept of a wormhole is an Einstein-Rosen bridge. A trip through the wormhole could take much less time than a journey between the same starting and ending points in normal space. Wormholes have various types, intra-universe wormholes (connecting two distant regions of our Universe with each other) and inter-universe wormholes (that connect our Universe with another universe).gravitational-singularitiesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1808Related#kerr-black-holeswz-sagittae-stars (Preliminary)WZ Sagittae starsA subclass of dwarf novae with an extremely long outburst period, comparable with that of a recurrent nova.dwarf-novae, cataclysmic-variable-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1809x-ray-active-galactic-nuclei (Preliminary)X-ray active galactic nucleiactive-galactic-nucleiSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2035x-ray-astronomy (Preliminary)X-ray astronomyThe study of celestial bodies using their X-ray emission. X-ray astronomy deals mainly with Galactic and extragalactic phenomena involving very high-energy photon emissions, covering a band of energies between 0.1 keV and 500 keV. The research field includes: X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, pulsars, black holes, dark matter, active galaxies, galactic clusters X-ray transients. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays coming from outer space. X-ray astronomy therefore requires observations to be done above atmosphere. The first rocket flight which successfully detected a cosmic source of X-ray emission was launched in 1962 by an American research group. A very bright source was detected that they named Scorpius X-1. Since then several dedicated X-ray astronomy satellites have been launched, among which: Uhuru, INTEGRAL, ROSAT, Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), Chandra X-ray Observatory, and XMM-Newton, which have contributed to important advances in astronomy.astronomical-methodsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1810Related#x-ray-sourcesNarrowerx-ray-identificationx-ray-bright-pointx-ray-binary-stars (Preliminary)X-ray binary starsA binary star system where one of the stars has evolved and collapsed into an extremely dense body such as a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. The enormous gravitational attraction of the massive, dense, but dim component pulls material from the brighter, less massive star in an accretion disk. The gravitational potential energy of the accreted matter is converted to heat by viscosity and eventually to high-energy photons in the X-ray range. The brightest X-ray binary is Scorpius X-1.semi-detached-binary-stars, compact-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1811Related#x-ray-sourcesNarrowerhigh-mass-x-ray-binary-starsx-ray-bursterslow-mass-x-ray-binary-starsx-ray-bright-point (Preliminary)X-ray bright pointx-ray-astronomySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1812x-ray-bursters (Preliminary)X-ray burstersx-ray-transient-sources, x-ray-binary-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1813Related#x-ray-burstsx-ray-bursts (Preliminary)X-ray burstsA rapid and intense surge of X-ray emission from some sources.

X-ray sources contain an extremely hot gas at temperatures from 10^6 to 10^8 K. They are generated by various physical processes involving high energies, such as accretion on to a compact object, shock waves from supernovae, stellar winds, hot gas in stellar coronae, or hot spaces between galaxies in a cluster. The first celestial X-ray source, after the Sun, to be detected was Scorpius X-1 by means of rocket flight.astronomical-radiation-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1822Related#x-ray-binary-stars#x-ray-astronomy#solar-x-ray-flaresNarrowerx-ray-burstscool-coresultraluminous-x-ray-sourcesx-ray-transient-sourcesdiffuse-x-ray-backgroundx-ray-point-sourcesx-ray-stars (Preliminary)X-ray starsemission-line-starsSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1823Narrowersingle-x-ray-starsx-ray-surveys (Preliminary)X-ray surveyssurveysSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1824x-ray-telescopes (Preliminary)X-ray telescopesA telescope designed to focus X-rays from astronomical objects.

Recurrences can be periodic or aperiodic, but there is no obvious correlation between recurrence time and the luminosity amplitude of the outburst. X-ray transients seem to be divided into two classes: those associated with high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) stars and those associated with low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) stars. The HMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole paired with a massive star. Often, the stellar companion is a Be star, Be star, which sometimes sheds material from its equatorial region. In these systems, the transient event is characterized by having more higher energy X-rays in the spectrum. The LMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole orbiting around a cooler, low-mass star. These transient events often generate more lower-energy X-rays.transient-sources, x-ray-sourcesSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1852Related#x-ray-burstsNarrowerx-ray-burstersxallarap-effect (Preliminary)Xallarap effectbinary-source-microlensingSame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2139xenobiology (Preliminary)XenobiologyThe study of synthesizing and manipulating biological devices and systems.astrobiologySame Ashttp://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1826y-dwarfs (Preliminary)Y dwarfsA type of ultra-cool brown dwarf with an effective temperature lower than 500 K.
