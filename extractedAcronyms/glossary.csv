AU,Astronomimcal Unit,"More Information Astronomimcal Unit (AU)a unit of length often used in expressing distances in the heliosphere. The International Astronomical Union defines 1 AU as 149,597,870,700 m. The value corresponds roughly to the average Sun-Earth distance. "

GCRs,the intensity of galactic cosmic rays,Forbush Decrease(FD) A sudden decrease in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) recorded at several ground neutron monitors. Such decreases occur when the strong interplanetary magnetic field in a CME prevents a portion of GCRs from reaching Earth. After CME passage the cosmic ray intensity gradually recovers. 
AE,"Kp, auroral electrojet","Geomagnetic Activity Natural variations in the geomagnetic field classified qualitatively into quiet, unsettled, and active/storm. Geomagnetic activity may be described quantitatively by one of several geomagnetic indices including the Kp, auroral electrojet (AE) and/or Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) indices, or by the location of visible aurora "

SEP,of extreme solar energetic particle,"Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) A category of extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events. During such events there are a sufficient number of energetic ions with energy above ~500 MeV, which interact with the Earth’s atmosphere to create quantities of secondary neutrons and/or muons measurable by ground‐based instrumentation.

SEPs,mass ejections. These solar energetic particles,"Polar Cap Absorption (PCA) Event An unusual condition of the polar ionosphere where HF and VHF (3-300 MHz) radio waves are absorbed, and LF and VLF (3-300 kHz) radio waves are reflected at lower altitudes than normal. These effects make transpolar radio transmissions at HF and VHF frequencies difficult or impossible. The final result may be a radio blackout. PCAs generally originate with particles (protons) energized by fast coronal mass ejections. These solar energetic particles (SEPs) arrive within a few minutes to hours after the start of the eruption and maximize within a day or two of onset. In practice, the absorption is inferred from the proton flux at energies greater than 10 MeV, so that PCAs and proton events are simultaneous. "
