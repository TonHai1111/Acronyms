SET,Space Environment Technologies,"Space Weather Glossary and Terms Standardization Space weather, which is the transfer of energy from the Sun to Earth by photons, particles, and fields, represents a dynamic phenomena affecting our advancing technology and is of interest to agency, academic, and industry users. This glossary is provided as an updating community service to help define many terms in space weather. It is a joint collaborative effort between the University of Colorado-Boulder Space Weather Technology Research and Education Center (SWx TREC) and Space Environment Technologies (SET) in an academic-industry partnership benefitting the space weather enterprise.

AU,Astronomimcal Unit,"More Information Astronomimcal Unit (AU)a unit of length often used in expressing distances in the heliosphere. The International Astronomical Union defines 1 AU as 149,597,870,700 m. The value corresponds roughly to the average Sun-Earth distance. "
AE,Auroral Electrojet,Image Auroral Electrojet (AE) Index 
FD,Forbush Decreas,Image Forbush Decrease(FD) 
G,disturbances,"G-Scale NOAA Space Weather Scale ranging from 1 to 5 for geomagnetic storm disturbances (G). It is based on the Kp index and is associated with disturbances in the geomagnetic field, aurora and sometimes power grid upsets "
AE,"Kp, auroral electrojet","Geomagnetic Activity Natural variations in the geomagnetic field classified qualitatively into quiet, unsettled, and active/storm. Geomagnetic activity may be described quantitatively by one of several geomagnetic indices including the Kp, auroral electrojet (AE) and/or Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) indices, or by the location of visible aurora "
